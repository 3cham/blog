--------------
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: if you're shooting for second place, your strategy is 
determined by the leader. Leverage the leader's strength into a 
weakness. Don't try to be better than the leader, try to be 
different. E.g. Pepsi marketed itself as a "choice for the new 
generation" when faced with Coca-cola's "old and established" brand. 
</P>

<P><I>My comment: sounds correct although doesn't apply to those who do have ambitions to overtake the leader in exactly the same category (which happens e.g. Excel took over Lotus 1-2-3 by being a better spreadsheet, not a different spreadsheet).</I></p>
