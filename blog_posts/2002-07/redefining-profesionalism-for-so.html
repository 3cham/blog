--------------
Philip Greenspun is unique among those who write about programming in 
that he doesn't confine himself to writing about the nitty-gritty 
details of technologies but occasionally writes about subjects that 
go beyond that.
<p>In <A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010604035443/www.arsdigita.com/asj/professionalism">Redefining Professionalism for Software Engineers</A> 
he wrote about the professionalism as applied to Software Engineers.

The history of this article is interesting - it first appeared in 
ArsDigita Systems Journal, an ambitious (but failed) project at 
Greenspun's ambitious (and also failed) company. At some point it 
must have been considered too controversial since it has been 
unlinked from ASJ's index. </p>
<p>Today ArsDigita and the whole ASJ is gone 
but we can still enjoy it thanks to the wonderful
<A href="http://web.archive.org/">web archive</A>.
