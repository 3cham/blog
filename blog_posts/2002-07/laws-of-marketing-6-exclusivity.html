Title: Laws of marketing #6 (exclusivity)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a>says: it's fruitless to try to take over a word that is 
already owned by a competitor. Burger King tried to own word "fast" 
which was already owned by McDonald; and failed miserably. FedEx 
tried to take over "worldwide" from DHL.

<P><I>My comment: this talk about "owning" words is a bit silly. 
The book doesn't say anything about how to actually own the word.
I guess you're supposed to use it in your marketing/advertisement
material but such statement is not very helpful for a marketer 
(I think; I'm not one).</I></p>
