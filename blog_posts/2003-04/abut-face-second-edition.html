<p>I became a fan of Alan Cooper after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672316498/">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a>. I then read About Face. I was pleasantly surprised when I found a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764526413/">new edition of About Face</a> while strolling through my local Barnes &amp; Noble. Cooper is successful, opinionated and makes sense. If UI design, oops, I mean interaction design, is your thing, go and read the book.</p>
