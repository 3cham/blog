<p>
This idea of "release early, release often" might actually work. A day after releasing first public version of VisualAck, my visual grep tool for mac, I'm releasing another version which includes an improvement <a href="http://visualack.uservoice.com/forums/34392-general/suggestions/453734-remove-escape-sequences-from-output-when-redirecte?ref=title">suggested in the forum</a>: to not highlight matches with control sequences when not printing output to a tty (e.g. when output is redirected to a file).
</p>
<p>
To complement that, I've added ack-compatible options <code>--[no]color</code> and <code>--[no]colour</code> to force or disable highlighting matches.
</p>
<p>
This, of course, only applies to command-line <code>vack</code> utility and not the UI.
