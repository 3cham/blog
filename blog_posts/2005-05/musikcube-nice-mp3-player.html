<p>My latest software find: <a href="http://www.musikcube.com/page/main/screenshot">musicKube</a> is your basik music (mp3, ogg and flac) player.</p>

<p>What's good about it: it's a low-resource program with UI similar to iTunes. Compared to musikCube, iTunes is a real memory hog and uses much more cpu than it should. musikCube also beats WinAMP when it comes to the usage of resources (and I've never been a fan of WinAMP's UI).</p>

<p>In the past I used <a href="http://www.foobar2000.com">foobar</a> as my low-resource player, but it has ugly UI and recently I found some file that simply crashed it when I was trying to add it to a playlist. Which is a bummer, because there's no way to figure out which file exactly (out of hundreds in the folder) is crashing.</p>

<p>So the good thing about musikCube is that it has both decent UI and low-overhead. It also doesn't block when adding songs to the library (unlike certain resource hog from Apple).</p>

<p>There are drawbacks:<br /><ul><br /><li>it doesn't play Apple's AAC or real audio or wma. For many that might be a deal breaker, for me it isn't (hopefully musicCube will get support for more formats, being open-source and all)<br /><li>it's variation on "shuffle" is a bit weird and inferior to iTune's<br /><li>I couldn't figure out their mass-tagging interface<br /><li>global hotkeys are not configureable and defaults are not to my liking<br /><li> "Net Radio" options doesn't seem to be doing anything<br /></ul></p>

<p>Despite those faults it looks like musikCube will become my player of choice for some time to come.</p>
