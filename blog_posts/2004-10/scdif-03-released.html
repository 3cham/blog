--------------
<p>I've released version 0.3 of <a href="/software/scdiff">scdiff</a>. The fixes in this version:<br /><ul><br />  <li><a href="http://nerdmonkey.com">Eli Tucker</a> fixed a bug handling directories in cvs<br />  <li>no longer crash when handling <tt>svn remove</tt>. Still, handling of deleting files<br />  is far from perfect (currently they are silently ignored while we should show apropriate diff)</li><br />  <li>properly handle file names with spaces. Fix suggested by Raman Gupta</li><br /></ul></p>
