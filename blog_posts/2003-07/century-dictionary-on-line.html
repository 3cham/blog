--------------
<p><a href="http://www.global-language.com/century/">This</a> is an interesting project: putting a public domain (copyright expired) dictionary on-line. Too bad it's an exercise in showing the capabilities of a looser image compression technology DjVu (looser because it's too little too late) and not an exercise in making really good on-line dictionary.

<p>And a copyright side-note. The site has the following copyright statement: <i>"CGI software, user interface, and images are Â© copyright 2001 Global Language Resources, Inc."</i>. My question is: how can they copyright "images" given that they're merely a scanned version of a book in public domain?</p>
