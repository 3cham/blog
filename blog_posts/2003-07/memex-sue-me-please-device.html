<p>Consider this quote from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm">As we may think</a>:

<blockquote><i>A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.</i></blockquote>

Is it just me or does that sound like something RIAA/MPAA/EvilBookPublisher wouldn't like you to do (to the point of suing you if you did)? Does that sound like excessive copyrights stand in the way of progress?</p>
