--------------
<p>Following the sage advice of releasing early and often, I'm releasing my magnum opus <a href="http://extremeoptimizationinc.org/">Extreme (size) optimization in C and C++</a>.</p>

<p>It's meant to be a book about techniques to make your C, C++ and even Objective-C (it being a superset of C) code as small as possible and use as little memory as possible. All based on real-life code.<br />It's certainly early (only one chapter is complete) and hopefully I'll be updating it often.</p>

<p>So give it a look and enjoy the extremism.</p>
