<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a> is an unusual <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg02667.html">keynote speaker</a> for a Python conference. What I like is that he asks the question about a language design that I've never seen being asked by others: how should a language for the next 100 years look like. There's a lot of different languages and even those most popular either happened as a research project or just happened. Graham designs <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">his own language</a> and he just might have a chance at doing it right.</p>
