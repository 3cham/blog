SumatraPDF team is happy to announce a 1.3 release of our free, small, fast, open source <span class="caps">PDF</span> reader for Windows.
 
	<p>Sumatra was capable of text selection for some time but this feature was hard to discover (you had to press Ctrl and select the area with a mouse). We improved text selection and copying by emulating the way a browser (and Adobe Reader) work: just select text with a mouse and use Ctrl-C to copy it to a clipboard.</p>
 
	<p>Shift + Left Mouse now scrolls the document and Ctrl + Left mouse continues to create a rectangular selection (for copying images).</p> 
 
	<p>We added more keyboard and mouse shortcuts:
	<ul> 
		<li>'c&#8217; shortcut toggles continuous mode</li> 
		<li>'+&#8217; / '*&#8217; on the numeric keyboard now do zoom and rotation</li> 
		<li>back/forward mouse buttons for back/forward navigation</li> 
	</ul></p> 
 
	<p>We added toolbar icons for Fit Page and Fit Width and updated the look of toolbar icons</p> 
 
	<p>In version 1.2 we introduced a new full screen mode and made it the default full screen mode. Old mode was still available but not easily discoverable. To make it more discoverable we&#8217;ve added View/Presentation menu item for new full screen mode and View/Fullscreen menu item for the old full screen mode.</p> 
 
	<p>We <a href="/article/8nqb/Writing-a-custom-installer-for-windows-software.html">rewrote the installer</a></p> 
 
	<p>We improved zoom performance and fixed crashiness caused by high zoom levels.</p> 
 
	<p>We improved searching for text to use less memory.</p> 
 
	<p>We improved printing.</p> 
 
	<p>We&#8217;ve updated translations contributed by our <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/translators.html">translators</a></p> 
 
	<p>We updated to latest <a href="http://mupdf.com/">mupdf</a> code for various improvements and bugfixes.</p> 
 
	<p>We now use <a href="http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/">libjpeg-turbo</a> library instead of libjpeg, for faster decoding of some PDFs.</p> 
 
	<p>We updated <a href="http://www.openjpeg.org/">openjpeg</a> library to version 1.4 and <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/">freetype</a> to version 2.4.4.</p> 
 
	<p>We fixed 2 integer overflows reported by Stefan Cornelius from Secunia Research.</p>
