When I'm right, I'm right. About a year ago "I said":/article/Why-Google-should-sponsor-a-faster-Python-VM.html that Google should sponsor faster Python VM. And that's "exactly what they did":http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow by having 2 full time engineers "working on unladden-swallow":http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/FAQ, a project to make Python much faster, with full intention to get all their improvements into mainline Python.

The project looks very promising.

It also shows that small teams can do great things. 2 people team is as small as it gets and if they manage to achieve their goal, they'll make a big difference in many programmer's lives.
