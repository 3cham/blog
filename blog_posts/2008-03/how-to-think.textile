# Synthesize new ideas all the time. No passive reading. Annotate, model,think and synthesize what you read.
# Learn how to learn (rapidly).
# Work backwards from the goal.
# Have long-term plan. It might change but you should have it.
# Make contingency maps. Draw dependencies on a big piece of paper, first finish things that don't depend on anything but on which other items depend.
# Collaborate.
# Make mistakes quickly.
# As you learn, write up best-practices protocols.
# Document obsessively.
# Keep it simple.

 Logarithmic time planning: the closer the event, the more granular scheduling.
