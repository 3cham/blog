<p><b>Show me the code.</b> <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/diary.html?start=281">Raph</a>:<br /><blockquote><i><br />But opinions are damn cheap. Any idiot can have them, and many do. Even smart people are tempted by pretty ideas. We're surrounded by a flood of wrongheaded opinions. The best way to convince me that your idea is one of the few good ones is to show me the code. <br /></i></blockquote><br />Another excellent post from Raph. The proof is always in the pudding.</p>
