<p>You don't need an ounce of innovation in order to have a very successful business. At least according to <A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/microsoft.html">David Wheeler</A>. I guess David's intention was just to show Microsoft in bad light but if you put 2 and 2 together, the inevitable conclusion is that you don't need any innovative ideas in order to have good business, sometimes even extremely good business. I guess many people (those hung up on "innovation") don't get, but it's just one of many examples that "innovation" per se is not equal to "good" or "profitable". Ideas are worthless, execution is what matters.</p>
