<p>Google's Chris DiBona sent me this e-mail, which I post verbatim:</p>

<p><blockquote><br />If you did follow apache or the linux kernel closely, you'd see googlers posting patches. That is why I called you lazy for not noticing this. I'm not really interested in outing engineers as working for google, but I know of at least 4 people in the linux credits file who work for us (with signifigant work, not for small things). These projects are not difficult to find.</p>

<p>I also think that Greg Stein wouldn't mind being 'outed' as a googler. (Greg is the Chair of the Apache Software Foundation and is the co-developer of subversion and a great amount of code for apache) The open source world is quite large, I don't expect you to know everyone in it. But if you plan on accusing us of parasitism....then you should do further research into our role.</p>

<p>Also, one other thing: You say I called you ignorant, but I did not say that. Ignorant is too strong a word...I chose to call you uninformed because only recently has google started to inform the public at large of our contributions to open source software development.</p>

<p>Please note my email address if you have any further questions about google and open source. Feel free to post this message in its entirety (but preserve the anti-spamming stuff, thanks!)</p>

<p>An occuring theme in bloggers vs. journalists wars is lack of<br />profesionallism on the part of bloggers. I'm going to do my part in<br />raising the bar among bloggers by doing some fact-checking.</p>

<p>I can't fact-check Google's contribution to Linux kernel, because, as<br />I understand it, 4 people involved prefer to remain anonymous.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lyra.org/greg/">Greg Stein</a> is indeed an established open source persona, ex-Microsoft and ex-collabnet<br />employee, now working at Google. Judging by <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-cvs&w=2&r=1&s=gstein&q=a">mailing list postings</a> for 2004, he is still actively<br />involved in Apache project, both in his role as the Chair of Apache<br />Foundation and ocasionally as a developer.</p>

<p>Regarding Python, In my research I only found a reference to the fact<br />that Greg <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/6531.html"><br />wrote httplib</a>, which ships with Python. A scan of <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/">python-dev mailing<br />list archives</a> did not show up posts by him in 2004 (I admit that<br />the methodology used, i.e. eyeballing, isn't too reliable). So I'll<br />assume that those days he's not an active contributor to Python.</p>

<p>Regarding Subversion, Greg's past contribution there are undeniable <br />(he was one of the architects and core developers) but I wouldn't call<br />him an active contributor during his Google days. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?list=dev&searchText=Greg+Stain&defaultField=sender&Search=Search">No posts</a> to Subversion dev<br />list in 2004, <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?a=103578887800012&r=1&w=2">around 30 posts</a><br />to subversion-issues and subversion-cvs lists. Generously, that's about<br />few days of work.</p>

<p>Greg started at Google <a href="http://www.python.org/~jeremy/weblog/040416a.html">around April 2004</a> (shortly after, in May 2004, he applied <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-cvs&m=108992005825497&w=2">this patch</a> adding Apache mime type mapping for Google-endorsed Atom syndication<br />format. I don't really know <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20440#c6">why I mentioned that</a>).</p>

<p>Starting date has relevance here since I'm looking for contributions<br />while being employed by Google, not before or after.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the reference to Apache project is only referring to Greg or to more people. Not knowing their names, I can't fact check it.</p>

<p>So that's 6 people so far, 4 anonymous Linux kernel developers, Greg and Jeremy<br />Hylton (a core Python developer).</p>

<p>In case you were wondering, Google has <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/facts.html">1,900+ employees</a>.<br />Google's market capitalization is <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG&d=t">52.71 billion</a> (compared to Microsoft's 290.49 billion, yhoo's 51.80 billion and Red Hat's 2.45 billion).</p>

<p>Last quarter earnings <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/10/22/googles_earnings_more_than_double/">were $805 million</a>, $52 million of it being a profit.<br />The profit would be $125 million if it wasn't for a patent dispute<br />with Yahoo. From which we can learn that software patents are a good way<br />to transfers large chunks of money from one company to another, with<br />hefty provision for lawyers and partially supported by me and you<br />(tax money used to pay for courts, judges salaries etc.) although I<br />don't quite get what is benefit for me from that. Will Yahoo! service<br />will be any cheaper because they won patent war with Google? If yes,<br />doesn't that mean that Google's service will more expensive? What do I,<br />as a consumer, gain from this battle over patents?</p>

<p>I gathered most of this information using Google's free search engine.<br />Market data retrieved thanks to free Yahoo! finance. I was able to<br />stay up till 5 A.M. thanks to tea which is not free but of negligible<br />cost.</p>

<p>And all of that has nothing to do with me being bitter about Google<br />not hiring me. Word.</p>
