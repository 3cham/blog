<p><b>Google saga, episode 204.</b></p>

<p>I really wanted to put this Google thing to rest but Adam's <br /><a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000040.html">passionate<br />response</a> prompted me to, once again, demonstrate my inability to<br />understand basic facts and demonstrate my narrow minded, <br />gasps-in-horror-invoking, world view.</p>

<p>In his latest post Adam <br />launches a desperate effort to show that Google doesn't have<br />to contribute back to open source, despite enjoying enormous benefit<br />specifically from open source software.</p>

<p>At the same time Chris DiBona, Open Source Program Manager at Google,<br /><a href="https://ssl27.pair.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/adambos/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=39"><br />commented on Adam's weblog</a> that Google does indeed contribute to<br />open source and we're just lazy and uninformed if we don't see that.</p>

<p>Seems that Google's party line on that subject isn't yet worked out.</p>

<p>Adam is about fourth person that made the following argument in response<br />to my post: it's ok to not contribute back to open source because<br />Google contributes so much otherwise back to the world in general.</p>

<p><b>Google - it's not a platform</b></p>

<p>I don't understand what is, in the context of this debate, the<br />message behind the story of how building software becomes easier<br />because of improvements to Windows. As much as it's true,<br />it's irrelevant.</p>

<p>It's true that improvements e.g. in Windows platform make writing software<br />that does more easier and easier. Switch from DOS to Windows made<br />it possible to write apps with graphical UI (something that was possible<br />but prohibitevely expensive in DOS). .NET also promises significant<br />improvements in programmer's efficiency etc.</p>

<p>Google cannot claim to be such a platform. Oh, do I hear Google API?<br />Read their <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/api_terms.html">TOS</a><br />and pay attention to 10k daily limit and "personal use only" clause.<br />It's as if Microsoft said that I can write Windows apps, but only for<br />my personal use and couldn't sell them.</p>

<p>Google has an inherent conflict of interest. They make money partly<br />by licensing their search technology. It's hard to imagine any service<br />that uses Google API and doesn't compete with Google. By definition,<br />it would be a superset of what Google does. Google will never loosen<br />their grip on their search results. They will never become a valuable<br />platform for others to freely use.</p>

<p><b>Google - get free stuff, love us back.</b></p>

<p>What is more clear is that Adam wants us to just love Google<br />for all the free stuff they give us and don't ask any hard<br />questions.</p>

<p>Except, none of this stuff is free. Google is in advertising business<br />and it turns out that it's a very good business.</p>

<p>While you and me don't have to pay for Google's search, gmail, Blogger<br />or groups, there are people who pay. A lot.</p>

<p>It's simply Google strategy<br />to give those things for free to general public (in the advertising<br />industry known as "eyeballs") and making money from ads they embed<br />within search results, gmail or groups. I don't know what's the<br />business behind Picasa or Keyhole but there's someone inside Google who<br />does (or thought he knew and is not looking for another job).</p>

<p>Google's products and services are not free, we pay for them dearly,<br />with our eyeballs.</p>

<p><b>Google - the selfish Giant.</b></p>

<p>Adam evokes Newton's humble admission "If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants."  Newton knew<br />that we all benefit from what<br />came before therefore the value of our own contributions, as big as they<br />might appear, is relatively small. But to Adam it's not about modesty.<br />In his re-interpration of Newton's words, the open source software<br />is the giant on whose shoulders Google stands.</p>

<p>I'll go with this analogy and point out that it's one thing to be<br />Newton, who made invaluable contributions to pool of knowledge <br />and offer it without restrictions to all of humanity.</p>

<p>It's quite another to be a corporation that stands on shoulders of others<br />but does not allow others to stand on their shoulders. Google might<br />be a giant but it's a selfish giant.</p>

<p><b>The gentle art of insult.</b></p>

<p>Notice that I did equate Chris and Adam with Google. You would think<br />that I would respect <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000039.html"><br />Adam's request</a> not to do it. You would think<br />that Adam would respect his own request not to do it. He starts his<br />response by not so subtly labeling Dare as "Microsoft apparachik"<br />(a really good one) and me as an "open source denizen". He does that to<br />imply that all we say comes from either Microsoft or open source agenda<br />as if we had no brains of our own and were unable to utter one<br />thought that is not meant to further the goals of our corporate masters.<br />Believe me, I worked at Microsoft and it doesn't pay *that* well.</p>

<p>The ironic thing is that Adam worked at Microsoft longer that me and<br />Dare combined. I worked at Microsoft longer than Dare (although I no<br />longer do). And Dare wrote much more open source code than I or<br />Adam did.</p>

<p>So who exactly should be called Microsoft apparachik and who deserves<br />to be called open source denizen is a matter of dispute, but you should<br />never let facts stand in the way of an insult.</p>

<p><b>It's not about Google.</b></p>

<p>It's too bad that all Adam sees in my post is criticism of Google.</p>

<p>The reason I wrote it was Adam's unfortunate plea to open source developers<br />to write, for free, very specific piece of software that would benefit<br />mostly large companies (as opposed to you and me). Companies that have<br />enough cash and resources to fund such software. That just crossed<br />decency line for me.</p>

<p>If it was written by Amazon's employee or Microsoft's<br />or Yahoo's, I would frame my argument as criticism of Amazon, Microsoft<br />or Yahoo. I enjoy kicking, who's laying on the ground doesn't really matter.<br />In case you haven't noticed, this is a weblog without honor or humanity.</p>

<p><b>The real point, if you can see it.</b></p>

<p>My real point was that those companies, instead of shamelessly asking for free<br />lunch, should strategically invest in open source products that are vital<br />to their business but are not their core business. For example,<br />I wouldn't suggest Google to open source their crawler, because that's<br />one of their competitive advantages. But if they use Python often<br />and it has flaws, they should pay their people to fix them and release<br />fixes back to public, so that everybody can benefit.</p>

<p>That's how open source is supposed to work, but, according to the<br />real world, doesn't.</p>

<p>Please tune in next week for another episode of Google saga. Am I really Adam's twin brother, separated at birth? Are we both in love with the same girl, Ada, who vanished 2 years ago, changed her sex and her name and is now best known for her involvement with XML community?</p>
