<p><a href="http://robotcoop.com/">The Robot Co-op</a> launched <a href="http://43things.com/">43 things</a> - a new social web-service where you can record things you want to do. The social aspect of  this service is the fact that you can see what other people want to do, see what goals are most popular, comment on goals etc.</p>

<p>The site is very well done but I think that a service has a self-destruction timer built in. At some point in the future, people will stop using it because it'll be too depressing for them.</p>

<p>We all have a lot of goals. We also complete less than 5 % of our goals. We don't kill ourselves over that only thanks to impressive ability of our brain to forget things. I know I've made plenty of great new year resolutions last year. I'm also pretty sure I didn't do most of them. But guess what, I don't remember what they were. I can happily make new resolutions that I'll forget in a few months.</p>

<p>If I remembered what I wanted to do last year and compared it to what I actually did, I would now be very depressed. If I start using 43 things, I'll never forget. I'm not taking my chances.</p>
