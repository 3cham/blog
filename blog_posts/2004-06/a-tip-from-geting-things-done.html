<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000280/">Getting things done</a> is a book about improving your productivity i.e. how to do more in less time.</p>

<p>Being efficient is about executing on ideas we have. One problem is that we have more ideas than we can execute on. The book can be summarized as a system for cataloguing the ideas, prioritizing them and executing  them.</p>

<p>One of the tips from the book: an important thing is to commit ideas from our head into some more permanent medium. If we don't they'll use up our mental energy. Book's system is based on paper but other tools can be used as well.</p>

<p>As for me, I'll experiment with using this weblog for recording my ideas (for those ideas that can be made public) and <a href="../../../2004/06/04/wikipedia-as-a-personal-wiki.html">my personal wiki</a> for ideas that I want to keep for myself. Let's see how it goes.</p>
