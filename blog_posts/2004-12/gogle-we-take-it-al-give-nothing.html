<p>I have a new hobby: <a href="../../../2004/12/25/google-ultimate-hypocrite.html">inventing advertising slogans</a> for Google. Being the nice guy<br />that I am, I grant Google non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use<br />those slogans in their marketing efforts.</p>

<p>Today, beside few new Google slogans, I give you the following shocking<br />revelations:<br /><ul><br /><li>open source doesn't work as well as they tell you<br /><li>Microsoft creates more open-source code than Google<br /><li>how to bring down Microsoft<br /></ul></p>

<p>This post is for mature audiences only, ridicules Google and everyone<br />who gets in the way, doesn't use web standards and is not XHTML compliant.<br />I don't even know what being XHTML compliant means.</p>

<p><b>Open-source - not working as advertised.</b></p>

<p>The popular theory ("myth" would be a better name) is that open-source<br />works because of this positive feedback loop:<br /><ul><br /><li>source code for product foo is released<br /><li>it's free so it gets used<br /><li>if it doesn't fully meet someone's needs, that someone can code the<br />functionality (since the code is open) and submit the changes back<br />to project (something not possible if you use closed products like Windows<br />or Office or Google)<br /><li>those contributions improve the product for everyone else, so more<br />people use it so more people contribute the code and so on. Sky is hardly<br />the limit.<br /></ul></p>

<p>The good thing in this theory is that it doesn't rely on kindness <br />of strangers but on englightened self-interest of those who benefit<br />from free software. The bad thing about this theory is that in theory<br />it works much better than in practice.</p>

<p>It's all because of a <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000038.html"><br />weblog post</a> by Google's Adam Bosworth. Read it yourself, but the gist<br />of it is that, according to Adam, commercial database vendors don't<br />understand the needs of companies like Google or Amazon or Federal Express.<br />Relational database rely on static schemas and there are no good ways<br />to dynamically reconfigure databases without the disruption in service.<br />Adam ends with a plea to open-source fairy:<br /><blockquote><br />My message is to the Open Source community that has, so ably, built LAMP<br />(Linux, Apache and Tomcat and MySQL and PHP and PERL and Python). <br />Please finish the job. Do for databases what you did for web servers. <br />Give us dynamism and robustness. Give us systems that scale linearly, <br />are flexible and dynamically reconfigurable and load balanced and easy <br />to use.<br /></blockquote></p>

<p>This is why the theory of open source doesn't work in real world. A <br />multi-billion company has a clear need for software that works well<br />for them but instead of investing in existing open-source projects<br />like PostgreSQL or MySQL to make them do what they need, all they<br />do is ask some magic, undefined entity they call Open Source community to<br />do the work for them. For free.</p>

<p><b>Google - we take it all, give nothing back. Come work for us.</b></p>

<p>Let's estimate how much money did Google save by using open source<br />software that they would otherwise have to purchase. The operating<br />system for tens of thousands of their computers. Web servers they use.<br />All the Unix utilities they use. Editors, compilers and debuggers they<br />use to write their code. E-mail smtp server. E-mail pop servers.<br />Languages like Perl and Python. Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.<br />It's safe to say that if Richard Stallman was never born, the licenses<br />for those kinds of software would cost them tens of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>And what does Google contribute back? Where are their patches to gcc,<br />gdb, python, postgresql, sendmail, emacs?</p>

<p><b>Google - we leave open-source to Microsoft. Come work for us.</b></p>

<p>It's very ironic that I can find more open-source code created<br />by Microsoft and its employees (<br /><a href="http://rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a>,<br /><a href="http://ironpython.com/">IronPython</a>,<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/">Windows Installer XML (WiX)</a>,<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexwiki/">FlexWiki</a>) than<br />by Google employees. Not saying that there aren't any but they are<br />certainly not easy to find, even when I use mighty search engine<br />trying to find<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=google+open-source&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">google open-source</a>.<br />   <br /><b>Google - we like our hardware cheap and our software free. Come<br />work for us.</b></p>

<p>If you're into this stuff you know that Google is known for it's highly<br />tuned process of selecting hardware components (i.e. all those thousands<br />of computers they need to index and store the web) to hit the best<br />price/performance ratio. In a way, they use the cheapest thing, when you<br />define the cost as the total cost of ownership (as opposed to simply<br />the cost of buying the hardware). Thanks to Adam's admision:<br /><blockquote><br />Indeed, in these days of open source, I wonder if the software itself,<br />should cost at all?<br /></blockquote><br />we also know, that they like their software free.</p>

<p>As a side note, it's a surprising statement coming from Adam who knows<br />very well that writing software costs a lot. Open-source doesn't<br />eliminate this cost, it just shift the costs and allows unlimited number<br />of free-riders, like Google.</p>

<p>I'm picking on Google, but they are not alone. Amazon, yahoo, ebay, <br />aol. Any large business that uses web as means of providing services and<br />making revenues is enjoying enormous savings by using open source<br />stack on their back end. And what do they contribute back? A good<br />approximation of zero compared to benefits they reap.</p>

<p>Another irony: compared to this bunch Microsoft looks good, they<br />are the only ones that did pay for the software they use on their back-end</p>

<p>The thing is: I actually believe that positive feedback loop in open<br />source is possible. Except that it requires enlightement on the part<br />of executives at all those companies. They should recognize that<br />they should invest in improving in open source software that they<br />use as their infrastructure. Not out of grattitude but because it makes<br />good sense in the long term. It's the cheapest way for them to get <br />software they use for building their services.</p>

<p>But Adam's example shows that there's a fat chance of this happening.<br />Adam is not a rank Google employee. He was not hired to give free massage<br />to stressed Google employees. Before Google Adam was a high-ranked executive<br />at Microsoft and BEA. He led teams that created successful products (IE,<br />Access among them). He's in position to influence what Google does.<br />He understands technology, he understand the cost<br />and difficulty of making software. He has a weblog and deep thoughts.<br />If only he understood the strategic value of open source.</p>

<p>If someone like Adam cannot see further than the tip of his own nose<br />and his ideas are as bold as asking others to write the software<br />he needs for free, then I don't have much hope for anyone at <br />aol to get it either.</p>

<p><b>The Art of War - how to bring down Microsoft.</b></p>

<p>As an additional bonus, my prescription on how amazon, yahoo, ebay, aol and<br />ibm could band together and bring down microsoft. The reason Microsoft<br />is a competition to almost anybody who gets big, including yahoo, aol,<br />ibm and google, is that in order to fuel their growth, they have to<br />enter every profitable, software-related business. They are late to<br />almost every party, be it web browser, game consoles, instant messaging,<br />free web e-mail, webloging, decent search but they're still a formidable<br />enemy because they can fund those businesses longer than anybody else<br />thanks to their cash cows: Windows, Office, SQL Server and Exchange.</p>

<p>Kill those cash cows and Microsoft has nothing. They can no longer<br />support money-loosing businesses for years.</p>

<p>At this point no other company can hope to make good business in those<br />markets. There are open source alternatives but they are not good enough<br />to make switching to a non-Microsoft solution a possibility.</p>

<p>Combine the resources of google, yahoo, aol, ibm and invest serious<br />money into open source projects. Improve Linux, drivers, desktop<br />apps to be as good as Windows. Invest in Open Office to kill Office.<br />Invest in Firefox so that there's no reason at all to use IE. Invest<br />in Thunderbird so that it can replace Outlook, including Exchange<br />connectivity. Invest in PostgreSQL to kill SQLServer. Invest in<br />something to replace Exchange. And be prepared to hire 50 thousand<br />available Microsoft developers.</p>

<p><b>Google - do no Evil. Do no Good. Just like everybody else. Come<br />work for us.</b></p>

<p>Let's consider the moral side of the story. Is Google (or any other <br />company) that benefits so much from open-source obliged to contribute<br />back? And I don't mean in a token way, like donating $100 to Mozilla<br />foundation. I'm talking about investing at least 10% of estimated savings<br />back into open source. Either by donating money to established venues<br />like EFF, FSF, Mozilla Foundation or by hiring developers to spend<br />all their time developing the code for open-source projects.</p>

<p>In those days of focus on corporate profits (where there any other days?), Google's motto "Do no Evil" is refreshing.</p>

<p>Or is it? It's a nice soundbite, but when you think about it, it's<br />really a low requirement. There are very little things that deserve<br />to be called Evil. If a senior citizen is taking a nap outside his house on a sunny day and you kick him in the groin - that's<br />Evil. Most other things are bad or neutral. Not doing Evil is easy.<br />Doing Good is the hard thing.</p>
