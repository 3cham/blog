<p>I'm guilty of liking to play with settings on my computer. One of the things I change once in a while is the font I use for writing software. Since I do it a lot, it is important to me. However, I always get back to standard Windows Lucida Console font.</p>

<p>Enter a recent find <a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">Bitstream Vera Sans Mono</a> (found through this <a href="http://www.lowing.org/fonts/">list of mono-spaced fonts</a>.</p>

<p>I've been using it for quite a while and I'm pleased. Not sure if it's actually better than Lucida Console,  but it's just as good and it's different. One good thing is that it has dot inside '0' (the number zero) so that it's easy to tell it from 'O' (the letter O).</p>

<p>As a side note: the interface for adding new fonts in Windows is abysmall.</p>
