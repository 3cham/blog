<p>When you look at TOS of Google, you'll find that one thing you absolutely cannot do is to scrape results returned by Google.</p>

<p>They've build their whole business on scrapping, storing and re-formatting web pages created by others. They're sultans of scrapping. And they have the gall to tell you that scrapping them is illegal.</p>

<p>Google - king of hypocrits.</p>

<p>Google - we scrap a lot.</p>

<p>Google - don't scrap us, we'll scrap you.</p>
