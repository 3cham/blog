--------------
<p>I needed to write a program to automatically cleanup some of ID3 information in my mp3 files. I also wanted to do it in Python, since of all languages that I know well, I'm most productive in python.</p>

<p>After some research I concluded that the best but little known option is <a href="http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Development/Mutagen">mutagen</a> library.</p>

<p>It's written in pure pyth0n, can both read and write ID3 tags as well as FLAC and Vorbis tags and has a nice API. It's largely undocumented but you can figure things out by looking at its code and a sample program.</p>

<p>I also looked at <a href="http://eyed3.nicfit.net/">eyed3</a> but it has much worse API and <a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/id3reader.html">id3reader</a>, but it can only read and has just been abandoned.</p>

<p>According to Google mutagen isn't a popular way to process id3 information in mp3 files, but it seems to be the best.</p>
