Just finished reading the book ["Renegades of the
empire"](http://www.amazon.com/Renegades-Empire-Software-Revolution-Microsoft/dp/0609807455/).

It's a fascinating story about how DirectX (multimedia technology from
Microsoft) came to be. The story is centered around three key people who
worked hard to get it done and evangelize. It paints a very interesting
picture of how things work inside Microsoft - that it's not a united
machine all marching in one direction but that internal fights and
competition is as intense as Microsoft's competition with other firms.
