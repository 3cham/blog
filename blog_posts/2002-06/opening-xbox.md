Just finished reading half of the book "Opening Xbox". Interestingly all
the characters from "Renegades of the empire" are briefly mentioned
(since they did DirectX, technology that was later used in Xbox). But
the main thing I got from the book is that right know there are many
people working on things that later become a history. There are people
and technologies about whom books will be written, just like a book has
been written about Xbox, DirectX or eBay. The question is: are you one
of those people? Are you making the history? If not, why not?
