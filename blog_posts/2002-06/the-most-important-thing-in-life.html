"The most important thing in life is to be free to do things. There are only two ways to insure that freedom &#151; you can be rich or you can you reduce your needs to zero. I will never be rich, so I have chosen to crank down my desires. The bureaucracy cannot take anything from me, because there is nothing to take"</blockquote></p>
