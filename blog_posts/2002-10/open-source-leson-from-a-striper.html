<p>Hear <a href="http://stripper-faq.org/money.htm">this:</a><br /><blockquote><i><br />If they're used to getting it for free it's going to be hard to get them to pay for it.<br /></i></blockquote><br />People writing open-source software hoping to make money off the software should seriously consider this piece of information. Learn from strippers, I say.</p>
