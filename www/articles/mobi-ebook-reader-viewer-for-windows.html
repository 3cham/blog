<h2>Details of mobi format</h2>

<p>Mobi format was invented by French company <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Mobipocket">
MobiPocket</a> as an ebook format for their MobiPocket Reader application. The company was
bought by Amazon and the format was used in Amazon's Kindle. Unfortunately Amazon added
DRM to the format, which means that only Amazon's software or devices are able to
read ebooks purchased from Amazon.</p>

<p>Mobi format is a simplified and adapted HTML. There is no official documentation of the
format, but it has been <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/MOBI">reverse-engineered and
documented</a> by the citizens of the internet.</p>

<p>Mobi files usually have .mobi extension. Amazon's eBooks have .azw extension. Because the
format was originally designed for Palm Pilot PDAs, they can also have .prc or .pdb
extension.</p>
