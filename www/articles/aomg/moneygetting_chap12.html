Engage in one kind of business only, and stick to it faithfully
until you succeed, or until your experience shows that you
should abandon it.  A constant hammering on one nail will
generally drive it home at last, so that it can be clinched.
When a man's undivided attention is centered on one object, his
mind will constantly be suggesting improvements of value, which
would escape him if his brain was occupied by a dozen different
subjects at once. Many a fortune has slipped through a man's
fingers because he was engaged in too many occupations at a
time.  There is good sense in the old caution against having
too many irons in the fire at once.
