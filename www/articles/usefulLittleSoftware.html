<p>
<B>Note</B>: This is the software I've personally used and found useful for one thing or another. Hope you'll find it useful too. </p>
<P><A href="http://www.sourcedyn.com//">Source Insight</A> - nothing I've seen (and I've seen a lot) beats Source Insight when it comes to working on large-scale (from thousands to millions lines of code) C/C++ projects (also supports Java and C# although I myself have mostly used it for C/C++ code). Give it a try - they have fully functional time-limited trial version. Build a project for your latest big C/C++ program. Or go ahead and just use it on Linux kernel sources. Play around. I'll be amazed if you're not amazed how this software helps in navigating and understanding the code. $249</P>

  a  Win32 Telnet/SSH GUI client. $Free.
