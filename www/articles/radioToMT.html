<h1>Migrate from Radio Userland to MovableType</h1>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

        <P>This article describes how to migrate (transfer your blog postings) 
          from <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">MovableType.</a> 
          I'm not gonna dwell on why to do that. Personally, I wanted something 
          that is not desktop-bound so that I can post from anywhere and I also 
          wanted some things that were not present in Radio, namely ability to 
          do extensive web site stats.</P>
		  
<h3>The problem</h3>
		  
        <p>There are two problems: moving your template and moving your posts.</p>
        <p>You don't have to worry about the first problem if you also decide 
          to switch to some MT native template. I wanted to keep my Radio template. 
          Converting was a bit painful but not that difficult (mainly it's about 
          replacing Radio tags with relevant MT tags).</p>

        <p>The second problem is transferring the posts. Fortunately MovableType 
          has a feature to import/export posts if they are in a format supported 
          by MovableType. Therefore the problem is reduced to exporting Radio 
          posts to MovableType format. Radio can export posts in XML format, one 
          file per post. In my case those posts were in <code>c:\Program Files\Radio 
          UserLand\backups\weblogArchive\posts</code> directory. If those files 
          are not present go over Radio's preference settings - I'm pretty sure 
          there's an option somewhere to force Radio to generate those.</p>
		  
		  
        <p>So I wrote <a href="radio2mt.py.html">radio2mt.py</a> script to convert 
          all posts to MovableType format. This script is based on<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000159"> 
          Aaron's script</a>. It's not perfect and has some code dealing specifically 
          with my posts, so you might need to tweak a few options to get everything 
          right. </p>
		<p>The main redeeming quality of this script is that it tries to preserve 
          the links within the weblog (i.e. in those cases where you link to your 
          own posts).</p>
        <p>The conversion procedure is very simple: 
        <ul>
		  <li>use the script <code>radio2mt.py &gt; allposts.txt</code> to convert Radio posting to a MT file <code>allposts.txt</code>
		  with all posts</li>
		  <li>copy this file to your MT installation directory under <code>import</code> 
            (as described <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_importing.html#importing%20entries">in 
            the manual</a>)</li>
		  <li>import entries and regenerate your blog</li>
		</ul></p>
		You can also setup redirects from the old site using a bit of JavaScript:
	 <pre>&lt;<span class="function-name">script</span> LANGUAGE=<span class="string">&quot;JavaScript&quot;</span>&gt;
&lt;!--
 function redirect()
 { 
  window.location = <span class="string">&quot;http://blog.myself.org/&quot;</span>
 }
 
 setTimeout(<span class="string">&quot;redirect();&quot;</span>, 5000)
//--&gt;
&lt;<span class="function-name">/SCRIPT</span>&gt;
</pre>

A tip: if you're importing to a new MT blog (without any posts) and screw something up,
you can delete all posts using <code>mysql</code> by doing <code>delete from mt_entry;</code>.
I had to do it a few times while tweaking the converter code.
