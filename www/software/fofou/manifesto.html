			<h2>Fofou manifesto</h2>

<p>Fofou is forum software
optimized for software product support/discussions. Free to use, easy to install
and free to run, thanks to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google's
App Engine</a>.</p> 

<p>I believe that every software product (be it open source
or commercial) should have associated forums so that users can ask questions
about the software, suggest improvements or simply tell you how much they love
your software.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately most forum software is bad. I call it
phpBB-disease (although it's probably UBB that is the root of all evil in this
case). The sad fact of life is that popular software gets cloned. That, by
itself, isn't bad, except in cases where the popular software is bad. phpBB is
bad but people who write their own forum software mindlessly copy its design,
just because it's popular, with only minor variations. The end result is that we
get more and more of the same awfulness.</p> 

<p>The first reason why most forum
software is bad for software support is that it requires registration. Software
forums are mostly for casual interaction: ask one question, report one bug,
suggest one feature. Asking someone to register just to do that is stupid and a
great way to turn away a big percentage of people. I've been in that situation
myself and it makes me angry when a software vendor makes me jump through hoops
just to report a bug in their software.</p> 

<p>Another reason, harder to
describe succinctly, is that most forum software is way too complicated. They
show way too much information, for example a date when user registered. On every
page. First: who cares? Second: I always confuse that with the post date,
because it's more visible.</p> 

<p>They encourage creating multiple forums on the
side, which doesn't make sense in low-frequency forums. But the functionality is
right there, the interface is optimized for showing multiple forums so hapless
developer creates a separate forum for bug reports, another one for
announcements, another one for feature requests, another for miscellaneous
discussion about the product and yet another about miscellaneous discussion
about everything else and then over months experiences what it's like to host
dead forums with nary a post per month. One forum is enough for everything until
the volume justifies creating more forums.</p> 

<p>That's just two example out of
many - most developers endlessly add more and more features and few are willing
to <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php">Get Real</a>.</p> 

<p>But once in a while someone comes in and shows that
there is a better way. In case of forum software it was Joel Spolsky who wrote
forum software from scratch for the needs of his software company. Even more
importantly, he <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html">described
eloquently</a> what kind of mistakes most forum implementations make and how his
forum fix those mistakes.</p> <p>The code for his implementation is not
available but Wayne Venables wrote <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fruitshow">FruitShow</a>, a
re-implementation of Joel's ideas in PHP.</p> 

<p>Which brings me to another
reason why most forum software is bad: it's hard to install. Even when the code
is free, it's still a hassle to run your own server, install Apache, PHP and
MySQL and make sure it all runs fine.</p> 

<p>This is where Fofou comes in: it
re-implements Joel's forums on Google App Engine infrastructure, so not only is
it easy to deploy your own copy but it's also free to run (it's very unlikely
that you'll go over Google's free quota).</p> 

<p>Fofou is also <a
href="http://github.com/kjk/fofou">an open-source project</a>, so you're free to
mess with it, change it any way you want and contribute improvements.</p> 

<p>I believe that thanks to ease of development, ease of deployment and generous free
quotas, App Engine has a potential to revolutionize the landscape of low-end web
hosting. App Engine is plenty powerful to host your website, blog, wiki, forums
and what not, for free, with better quality guarantees than most low-end web
hosts.</p> 

<p>It doesn't make sense to pay even $5/month for low-end web hosting
and mess with configuring web servers and databases and PHP software.</p> 

<p>It doesn't make sense to pay $5/month for TypePad blog, if you could install
TypePad-like software on App Engine and run it for free.</p> 

<p>It's even
attractive to use App Engine instead of free (read: ad supported) services like
blogger or wordpress.org, because you get rid of ads, you can install any blog
software you like and you get more control over the website.</p> 

<p>App Engine is still young so we're not yet at a point where this is true. The
biggest missing piece is availability of high-quality, free re-implementations
of the most common types of software people use: blogs, wikis, forums etc. Fofou
is here to give you one more choice when it comes to forum software.</p>
