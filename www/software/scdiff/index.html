<h1 id="what_is_it">What is it?</h1>
<p>
  Imagine this: you've just
  made changes to code kept in <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> or 
  <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository.
  You're ready to check them in but you want to take a last look at the changes.
  Usually you would do <code>cvs diff -u</code> or <code>svn diff</code>. This
  program allows you to see the changes with an external gui diff
  program. I find it much easier to understand the changes that way (as opposed
  to looking at unified diff in the console). By default
  it uses
  <code>windiff.exe</code> but you can use <code>-diff</code> option to select
  any other program (e.g. <a href="http://winmerge.org" title="WinMerge web page">WinMerge</a> or <a href="http://www.araxis.com/index.html" title="Araxis Merge website">Araxis
  Merge</a>) . Clearly, it's a tool for developers. </p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage </h3>
<p><code>scdiff [-h] [-old] [-cvs cvsCommand] [-cvsargs cvsOptions] [-diff diffProgramPath]</code></p>
<p>If you run scdiff without any arguments, it'll determine if a given directory
  is under CVS or Subversion control, check for locally modified files and launch
  external diff program showing local modifications. By default it uses windiff
  (assumes that windiff.exe is in the <code>%PATH%</code>) but you can use 
  <b><code>-diff</code></b> option to
  use any other diff program that can be launched from command lind. First two
  arguments given to the diff program are directories to diff. This works for
  all diff programs I've tested it (windiff, WinMerge and Araxis Merge).</p>
<p>By its nature (see <a href="#how_it_works">how it works</a> for more explanation) scdiff  uses temporary
  directory for storing original and modified files so even after you finish,
  you can still see the result of previous diff. Option <code>-old</code>
  does exactly that. It saves the time (getting files from repository
  may take some time). </p>
<p>To see built-in help, use <code>-h</code> option.</p>
<p>Option <code>-cvs</code> defaults to "cvs -z3". Option <code>-cvsargs</code>
defaults to "-u -N". In theory you shouldn't need to change them.

<h3 id="version_history">Version history</h3>
<p>0.4 (2004-12-08):
<ul>
  <li>add <code>-cvs</code> parameter to provide the name of cvs executable.
  Default is "cvs -z3".
  <li>add <code>-cvsargs</code> parameter to provide additional args to cvs. Default
  is "-u -N"
  <li>fixes for handling new and deleted files in cvs
</ul>
All 0.4 changes provided by <a href="http://www.dblock.org">dB</a>. 

<p>0.3 (2004-10-02):
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://nerdmonkey.com">Eli Tucker</a> fixed a bug handling directories in cvs
  <li>no longer crash when handling <tt>svn remove</tt>. Still, handling of deleting files
  is far from perfect (currently they are silently ignored while we should show apropriate diff)</li>
  <li>properly handle file names with spaces. Fix suggested by Raman Gupta</li>
</ul></p>
<p>0.2 (2004-06-08):
<ul>
  <li>now also shows files that only exists locally and are not present in <tt>cvs</tt> repository. If that 
  bothers you, learn how to use <tt>.cvsignore</tt></li>
  <li>show version number when displaying help</li>
</ul></p>
<p>0.1 (2004-06-03):
<ul>
  <li>first version</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how_it_works">How it works</h3>
<p>Not that it's terribly interesting, but just in case you were wondering. First,
  we capture the output of <code>cvs diff -u</code> or <code>svn diff</code>.
  From that we extract names of the files that are locally modified and the revision
  number of the file before modifications. The we check out the originals (using
  <code>cvs update -p -r rev</code> or svn cat ...), copy the originals to <code>$tempDir/sc_originals</code>,
  our locally modified copies to <code>$tempDir/sc_altered</code> and launch external diff
  program with <code>$tempDir/sc_originals</code> and <code>$tempDir/sc_altered</code> as arguments. Pretty
  simple and possibly suboptimal (subversion can do a diff without contacting
  remote repository, so it should be possible to significantly speed up the program
  if I knew how to get the original without asking remote repository).</p>

<h3 id="todo">Todo </h3>
<p>It's really a quick &amp; dirty program, so there's potential for a lot of
  stuff to be done. In the &quot;blue sky&quot; departement, I would like to
  have a full-fledged program for browsing changes in CVS or Subversion repositories.
  And no, it's not about re-writing <a href="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCVS</a> and
  the like for the fun of it. WinCVS does much more that what I need my ideal
  program to do, but it also doesn't do what I want (easily end efficiently
   browse changes).</p>
<p>But that's unlikely to happen, so here's a couple of things that could be
  fixed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>as noted in &quot;how it works&quot;, it should be possible to make Subversion case
    work without contacting remote repository</li>
  <li>currently you can't launch two copies at the same time because they use
    the same temp directory for storing files so the second copy will be unable
    to access temp directory </li>
  <li>currently windiff.exe must be in path. Could try to auto-detect full path
    by checking known paths or maybe looking in the registry </li>
  <li>auto-detect other diff programs like WinMerge and Araxis Merge </li>
  <li>downloading revisions from the repository takes time. Revisions do not
    change so they are perfect target for caching. We could locally cache revisions
    we retrieved so far to speed up a case of comparing local
    changes with the same revision multiple times. It happens quite often (we
    often get into develop/compare/fix/compare/fix/compare... cycle)</li>
</ul>

As noted, this program is simple, does one thing that is useful to me. It might
never get any better and there's not much to talk about. If you, however, have
a burning desire to talk to me about it (you know, comments, bug reports, suggestions
etc.), you can always <a href="/static/contact.html">send
me an e-mail</a>.
