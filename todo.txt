Todo next:
* page with tag cloud (/tags.html) with counts for each tag
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
* a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)
* better 404 handling (all should redirect to 404.html?${orig_url})
* provide long expires header for /gfx/search2.png and use /gfx/search2.png?$sha1(search2.png)
  (or md5) in code, so that we'll be fine if it ever changes

Maybe todo someday:
* show that preview failed. That is sometimes indication that posting will fail as well
  because the post is malformed
* comments
* ability to see previous versions
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* try design inspired by http://beej.us/guide/bgc/output/html/singlepage/bgc.html
* use minified version of code-higlighter js
