Todo next:
* automatically post about new blog entries to twitter
* archives.html should use articles_json, instead of us using another memcache data
* better 404 handling (all should redirect to 404.html?${orig_url})
* implement micro-blogging aggregator like http://dotat.at/:/ (automatically sync
  del.icio.us bookmarks every day)
* show articles tagged e.g. with 'fav' as another list on index page if in
  admin mode
* use http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/ for even less intrusive admin interface
* use http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/ for pop-up tags page
* preview in a separate tab, instead of taking half of the screen space
  (or maybe in a pop-up, using thickbox)

Twitter posting:
Basic auth
curl -u username:password -d status="your message here" http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json
username: registered username or email

Bitly:
login=login&apiKey=apiKey
version=2.0.1
format=json
e.g.:
http://api.bit.ly/shorten?version=2.0.1&longUrl=http://cnn.com&login=bitlyapidemo&apiKey=R_0da49e0a9118ff35f52f629d2d71bf07

Maybe todo someday:
* add per-tag atom feeds (/atom.xml?tag=tag) so that I can e.g. easily add feeds
  for sumatra-only announcements just by tagging announcement posts with unique
  tag
* steal http://www.codylindley.com/Archive/ design
* rename me.html to more.html and all the places that link to it
* move 22-markeging-laws.html to be a blog post
* move engineerign-school.html to be a blog post
* move learned-gold-rush.html to be a blog post
* move software-engineering.html to be a blog post
* delete sourceOfBugs.html and make that blog post public
* automatically tweet my posts
* better 404 page (show possible destinations, add manual redirects based on
  data from dashboard)
* ability to see previous versions
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* use minified version of code-higlighter js
* design where clicking on a tag shows overlayed window with articles with this
  tag (to make browsing more efficient)
* ability to tweet from my blog
* somehow integrate my del.icio.us tags into index page
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
