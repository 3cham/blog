Needed to switch:
* dup content detection via sha1 (must also work for editing when reverting to
  an older version)
* remove is_draft (will just use not public to mark drafts)

Maybe needed to switch:
* install redirects from older urls
* page with tag cloud (/tags.html) with counts for each tag

Rest:
* preview in the editor (by going to the server to render html)
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
* a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)
* on edit automatically focus edit field
* integrate evernote articles
* ability to see previous versions
