Needed to switch:
* integrate evernote articles
* dup content detection via sha1 (must also work for editing when reverting to
  an older version)
* disable import url after importing articles
* consolidate all blog posts into one file

Maybe needed to switch:
* install redirects from older urls
* page with tag cloud (/tags.html) with counts for each tag
* use minified version of code-higlighter js

Rest:
* preview in the editor (by going to the server to render html)
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
* a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)
* ability to see previous versions
* a better way to show tags (not inside h1)
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* try design inspired by http://beej.us/guide/bgc/output/html/singlepage/bgc.html
