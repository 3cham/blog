Todo next:
* page with tag cloud (/tags.html) with counts for each tag
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
* a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)
* better 404 handling (all should redirect to 404.html?${orig_url})
* on index.html, add tag cloud at the bottom
* implement micro-blogging aggregator like http://dotat.at/:/

Maybe todo someday:
* rename me.html to more.html and all the places that link to it
* move 22-markeging-laws.html to be a blog post
* move engineerign-school.html to be a blog post
* move learned-gold-rush.html to be a blog post
* move software-engineering.html to be a blog post
* delete sourceOfBugs.html and make that blog post public
* automatically tweet my posts
* better 404 page (show possible destinations, add manual redirects based on
  data from dashboard)
* ability to see previous versions
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* use minified version of code-higlighter js
* design where clicking on a tag shows overlayed window with articles with this
  tag (to make browsing more efficient)
* ability to tweet from my blog
* somehow integrate my del.icio.us tags into index page
