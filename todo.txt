Needed to switch:
* disable import url after importing articles

Maybe needed to switch:
* one-click "cleanup with html2txt" in the editor
* page with tag cloud (/tags.html) with counts for each tag
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
* a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)
* a better way to show tags (not inside h1)
* better 404 handling

Rest:
* comments
* ability to see previous versions
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* try design inspired by http://beej.us/guide/bgc/output/html/singlepage/bgc.html
* use minified version of code-higlighter js
