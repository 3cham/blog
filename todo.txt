Todo next:
* page with tag cloud (/tags.html) with counts for each tag
* month links at the bottom like in http://blog.quinthar.com
* a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)
* a better way to show tags (not inside h1)
* better 404 handling (all should redirect to 404.html?${orig_url})
* permanent delete
* provide long expires header for /gfx/search2.png and use /gfx/search2.png?$sha1(search2.png)
  (or md5) in code, so that we'll be fine if it ever changes
* don't show deleted posts in archives.html 
* doleted posts should not be part of navigation at the bottom
* show that preview failed. That is sometimes indication that posting will fail as well
  because the post is malformed
* ability to update published_on date when updating. This is useful for blog drafts (when I make a draft
  marked as private and when I publish I make it public, but I would like the published date to
  be when I published, not when it was first created)
* don't ping google if it's a private post
* show either "Create new post" or "Update post" in edit.html, depending on context
* bug: md5 can fail:
  File "/base/data/home/apps/kjkblog/1.331482218573471816/main.py", line 306, in txt_with_code_parts
    new_code_cookie = txt_cookie(new_code)
  File "/base/data/home/apps/kjkblog/1.331482218573471816/main.py", line 89, in txt_cookie
    txt_md5 = md5.new(txt)
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 52-53: ordinal not in range(128)

Which can kill atom.xml generation.

Maybe todo someday:
* comments
* ability to see previous versions
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* try design inspired by http://beej.us/guide/bgc/output/html/singlepage/bgc.html
* use minified version of code-higlighter js
