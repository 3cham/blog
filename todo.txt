Needed to switch:
* code high-lighting
* finish tags
 * page with tag cloud (/archive/tags.html) with counts for each tag
* support for markdown in /edit
* maybe a quick access to tags from everywhere (drop-down box)

Maybe needed to switch:
* on edit automatically focus edit field
* excerpts
* html_body
* test that private (!public) work as expected in:
  * archives
  * post
  * atom feed
  * main page
* add sitemap.xml ping + ping for google

Rest:
* integrate evernote articles
* show analytics if not localhost, add the logic to more pages
* display text as plain/text
* generic blobs (blob + mime type, for storing images, plain-text files etc.)
* ability to see previous versions
* ability to add pictures to posts
* ability to add attachement
* non-google search
