Title: Palm OS Developer Suite (PODS) 1.0 released

PalmSource finally released the <a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/dl/dl_tools/dl_pods/">final 1.0 version of PODS</a> (Palm OS Developer Suite).

I'm not terribly excited - I haven't even installed it yet. This is, however, the future of Palm OS development. PODS gives everything you need for writing C/C++ code for OS 5 and earlier and is the only tool that allows writing code for OS 6. The editor is based on Eclipse 2.1 and CDT (a plugin for writing C/C++ code) although Palm is planning to move to Eclipse 3 in the future.

It also have C/C++ compilers (uses open-source prc-tools for pre-OS 6 code) and Palm's in-house ARM compiler for OS 6. As a side note: it's a strange decision by Palm to develop (or license - don't know the inside details on who wrote that compiler) an in-house ARM compiler instead of just using gcc (with modifications, if any are necessary). PalmSource is cash-strapped - they clearly can't afford to hire as many programmers as they should - and it seems to me that taking gcc code and funding necessary modifications (if any) would be much cheaper than writing or licensing the whole compiler.

PODS also includes debuggers and simulators.

PODS is important because it's the future. Before PODS developers had a choice between CodeWarrior, which includes IDE but is expensive, and prc-tools (free but there's no IDE and it's not as good).

Now PalmSource is giving IDE as good (if not better) as CodeWarrior for free so I doubt that Metrowerks is going to try to compete and sell dev tools for Palm OS in the future.

At this point PODS is the only tool that allows writing code for OS 6.

I'm not jumping up and down from joy because at this point there's no reason to write OS 6 apps - there are no devices that actually ship with OS 6 (despite the fact that it has been officially released at the end of 2003). Even after devices are available it'll take years for OS 6 to have significant market share and given that it can run pre-OS 6 apps just fine, there's little reason to hurry.
