Title: Ecto for Windows - first (bad) impressions.

<b>Ecto for Windows - first (bad) impressions.</b>

My search for a decent blogging windows desktop client continues. I tried
them all and today I tried another one: <a href="http://ecto.mineblogging.com">ecto</a>, build 0.3.3.1 (Yet Another Cryptic Build Numbering System).
<p>
Ecto journey was short and here are my first (bad) impressions.
<p>
I downloaded, installed and launched ecto. Ecto
informed me that "This might be the first time ecto is run. Please enter your
user information" which was very unnecessary. This message should be gone and I
should be taken straight to profile setup window instead.
<p>
The splash screen is visible when "Profile Setup" window is shown.
Why? At this point it's totally unnecessary and annoying. It's "always on top"
window; although it doesn't cover other ecto's windows, it does obscure
all other applications e.g. the editor in which I'm writing this review.<p>
Profile setup dialog box (where you enter you XML-RPC api entry point) - I've
seen better. Could use some re-design. One of the Mac blogging tools had a very nice interface for providing weblogs
settings - I forgot which one but the authors of ecto should survey other
blogging clients and steal the best interface. Theirs isn't.
<p>
In "Profile Setup" window I entered my MovableType weblog setup data: profile 
name, username
and password and clicked "Apply" button. Ecto informed me (twice!) that "Specified
key is a known weak key for TripleDES and cannot be used." This error message is bad: 
<ul>
<li>it doesn't tell me what the problem is. I entered "profile name",
"username" and "password", not some "specified key"</li>
<li>uses techno-babble language that most people don't understand (I know what "TripleDES" is but I doubt 
many people do)</li>
<li>it doesn't tell me how to fix the problem</li>
</ul>
Two words to ecto's author (and anyone else designing error messages):
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764526413/">About Face</a>. <p>
Then I clicked "Save" button, hoping that the error message was
just an information. I forgot what exactly it did but since I didn't see an
expected reaction from ecto, I launched another copy. It showed me the same
information as the first run but the previous copy of ecto was running as well. I ended up with 2 "Profile Setup" windows, one splash screen
and one main window (the one where you enter posts). Main window was blocked by "Profile Setup" modal window. To
make things worse I couldn't even close ecto since it doesn't provide any close
button on &quot;Profile Setup&quot; window and no other button does the trick. I had to use "kill -f".
<p>My theory is that ecto, in a misguided effort to force me to use what it
thinks is a strong password, refuses to create a profile with a weak password.
The problem is that I already have a weblog with a password and I'm not going to
change it just to please ecto. Given those 2 constraints (my refusal to change
the password and ecto's refusal to accept my existing password) ecto is
completely useless for me. There's no way to exit ecto without creating a 
profile.<p>
Redesign advice: instead of refusing to accept "weak unspecified key", ecto
should accept it. At best it can display a message that explains that weak
passwords are bad (without using techno-babble filled with "TripleDES"
nonsense). But when I press "Shut the fuck up" button, it should accept any
password I give it. I'm the master here, not ecto. If I want to use blank
passwords that's my choice.
<p>
Summary: my first ecto experience was very bad. Ecto is unusable for me because it 
refuses to accept settings (presumably password) for my
existing Movable Type weblog. It has some obvious bugs (showing the same
dialog box twice, not being able to exit it, splash screen obscuring other 
applications) and the general feel of the interface is "an average for
software" which translates "substandard for actual use". Most software is
badly, carelessly designed and ecto is not an exception.
<p>
As you can imagine, this post has not been written using ecto. I'll try it again
when a new build becomes available, but judging from screenshots I'll have the
same complaints I had about all other blogging software I tried:
<ul>
<li>no spell-checking
<li>forcing me to save draft posts on the disk
<li>no full-text search of my previous posts
</li></li></li></ul>
Without those features blogging software is no better (and sometimes worse) than
using FrontPage for writing posts and web interface for posting.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
