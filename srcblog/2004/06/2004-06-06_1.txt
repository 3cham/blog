Title: Wish #1

Things that I wish someone would implement, issue #1.

Enable <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">gaim</a> to use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian's</a> skins. Skins are popular, skins are cool and Trillian has lots of them. It would be great if gaim could just use them.
