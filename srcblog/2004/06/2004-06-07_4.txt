Title: WordPress parmalink changes - is backward-compatibility included?

According to <a href="http://boren.nu/archives/2004/06/06/cruft-freeurls-everywhere/">this article</a> next version of WordPress will have a better, cruft-free permalinks. 

My question is: will this change be backward-compatible? One thing about permalinks is that they should be, well, permanent. 

I'm guessing that permalinks in WordPress are generated dynamically. If you change the algorithm to generate them, even the old permalinks will change.

What will happen if I upgrade WordPress in the future. Will my existing permalinks change to this new, cruft-free format?

I don't even have to say that it wouldn't be good. I want my permalinks permanent.
