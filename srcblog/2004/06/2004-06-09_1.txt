Title: Wish #2 - tabbed interface in putty

Wish: tabbed windows for <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a>. Putty is a free windows GUI telnet/ssh client. Excellent albeit minimalistic app. One thing that proven to be useful in other apps like text editor, IDEs and web browsers are tabs: ability to have more than one documents in the same window. It avoids polluting desktop with multiple windows.

Another thing that annoys me about putty is their preference setting dialog. It's confusing, especially for managing saved session. A better design is possible.
