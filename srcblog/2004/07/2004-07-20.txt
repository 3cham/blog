Title: Positive newspaper article on WikiPedia

Chicago Suntimes has published a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/worktech/cst-fin-andy20.html">positive article on WikiPedia.</a> It's good to see mainstream acceptance of the radical concept of encyclopedia produced by what many consider to be an equivalent of a million monkeys.

The author admits that the quality of WikiPedia articles is higher that what he had expected and names WikiPedia "one of the Internet's top 5 information tools".
