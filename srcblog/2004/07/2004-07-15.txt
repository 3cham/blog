Title: Review of "Hot text - web writing that works"

Review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735711518">Hot Text - web writing that works</a>.

Verdict: if you write for web, in any capacity, "Hot text" is worth reading.

At first "Hot text" threw me off with their hype-filled treatment of object-orientation (as applied to writing, none the less) and XML, but when it got to the meat of their advice on writing, I quickly forgot those initial awkward moments.

The book is written for those who want to improve their writing for the web. It offers both generic tips like:
<ul>
<Li> writing should be short, simple and clear
<li> break up long paragraphs into short ones
<li> make text scannable
<li> remove hype and marketoid speak
<li> write in active voice
<li> write with emotions
<li> have a personal voice
<li> link to other sites (gives you credibility)
</ul>
as well as addresses specific kinds of web content:
<ul>
<li> home page
<li> navigation menus
<li> help section and FAQs
<li> product information
<li> privacy policy
<li> e-mail responses to customers
<li> web marketing copy
<li> press release
<li> news
<li> webzines
<li> e-mail newsletters
<li> weblogs
</ul>

While not as deep and inspiring like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060006641">"On writing well"</a>,  it's filled with practical advice. and definitely worth reading for anyone who has to write for the web (especially those that don't have prior experience in copy writing).
