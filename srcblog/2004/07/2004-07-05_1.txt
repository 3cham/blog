Title: Dangers of upgrading - FireFox story

My willingness to upgrade to the latest and gratest versions of software has just went down a notch.

I've had a really nice setup with FireFox 0.8. Thanks to installing tab extensions and some tweaks I've had good browsing and good integration with external programs, mostly FeedDemon (i.e. clicking a link in FeedDemon would open the page in a new tab). It was quite stable (i.e. it would almost never crash but there were cases of getting into an infinite loop).

Then I upgraded to FireFox 0.9 and quickly after that to 0.9.1. That was a disaster. FireFox is (at least for me) much less stable i.e. it crashes daily. I came to a point where I'm afraid to open new pages because it might crash again and I'll loose all this unread pages in other tabs.

Also, the nice integration with FeedDemon is gone. I've re-installed tab extentions but now clicking on a link in external programs re-uses the current active tab. Very much something I don't want, I want a new tab! Setting DDE launch in user.js to false is supposed to change that, but it doesn't.

I've searched through forums and it seems I'm not the only one having such problem but there doesn't seem to be a solution that works for everyone.

Such is life of an early adopter.
