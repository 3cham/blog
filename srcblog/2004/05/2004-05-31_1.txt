Title: Wikipedia gets a face-lift

<a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> - a free, on-line, collaboratively edited encyclopedia has just improved its looks. If you ask me, the new look is much better. I find Wikipedia project fascinating because they achieved something that seemed impossible: high-quality source of information created by unwashed masses of Internet users.
