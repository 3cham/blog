Title: Of orkut and design issues.

I just signed up with <a href="http://www.orkut.com">orkut</a>. The site is slow and crashes a lot- that's their biggest problem. It's especially disappointing given orkut's google affiliation - google's website is THE speed demon.

But today I want to nitpick. I believe that good design is about the details. Truly awe-inspiring applications pay attention to smallest details. Orkut isn't such an application yet.

1. They tell me that I'm connected to "1591247 people". Now, quick, is it 1.6 million or 159 thousand? The number should either be rounded up in a reasonable way or shown as "1.591.247".

2. When you choose your username (btw: will they ever learn to simply use e-mail address as username? I already have it, it's already unique and I already remember it (as opposed to remembering which username I have on a given web site)) and this username is taken it informs you about that but fails to mention what was the username you've chosen.
