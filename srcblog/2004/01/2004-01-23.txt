Title: Mulberry 3.1 IMAP client.

<b>Mulberry 3.1 IMAP client.</b>
In my never-ending search for an ideal IMAP client after short evaluation period I purchased <a href="http://www.cyrusoft.com/mulberry/">Mulberry 3.1</a>. Evaluation period was short because I was getting more and more irritated by Thunderbird 0.4 (it started acting worse and worse). I can't say I'm very satisfied. Mulberry was supposedly designed for good IMAP handling. Unfortunately it wasn't designed for comfortable use. All e-mail clients have this irritating tendency to block UI when doing network I/O. I can sympathize with them (making snappy UI isn't easy) but I cannot forgive. Opera's M2 e-mail client is an example of UI responsiveness done right - when I click on a folder I'm immediately there - new messages are downloaded in background. Everyone else blocks and makes me white while they update the view with freshest data. The worst offender is Outlook - switching to another folder causes it to redownload all the header. While it's a correct thing to do (since that's the only way to stay in sync with the server) it shouldn't block the UI with a progress-showing dialog box. For a brief time I was using dual setup: Mulberry for reading new messages, Thunderbird for writing new messages. This is mostly because Mulberry gives me control over expunding e-mails (expunge strange IMAP thing) while Thunderbird doesn't show deleted-but-not-yet-expunged messages and, what's worse, doesn't let me expunge messages in other folders than Inbox. Another reason is that Thunderbird's spam detection sometimes is over-eager and gives false positives - which is very bad.
<p />
However, Mulberry's UI is ugly - in general and in particular. For the "in general" part - you just have to experience it. In particular, it took me a while to figure out that in order to create a new message I have to press button named "Draft". Very intuitive indeed. Mulberry exposes IMAP as it is, which has pros (people who care get a better insight into what's going on in their IMAP folders) and cons (most people don't care about such insight and are confused by it). There was a project <a href="http://www.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/M-HCI/Mulberry03/index.htm">Mulberry 2003</a> started in January 2003 whose goal was to improve Mulberry. Suggested improvements, while not earth-shattering, would help but they weren't implemented yet (and I didn't find any information that suggests that they will).
<p />
In the end I gave up on Mulberry and instead upgraded Thunderbird to a recent daily build (works better than official 0.4).
<p />
Now the only IMAP client I didn't evaluate is <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine</a>. Not that I didn't try - I just failed to setup it (Pine is very oldschool and setting it up involves editing text files). BTW: to get more information about IMAP that you probably care, go to "<a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/imap/isps/"> IMAP service providers</a> - A Step in Dealing with Viruses, Spam, and Email Overload". Site rich in information.</p></p></p>
