Title: A large, networked hard-drive needed.

Here's what I need: a large (we're talking 1 Terabyte-large), fairly quiet, networked (wi-fi, ethernet and usb 2.0 interfaces) hard-drive.

All we're talking here is just an enclosure for 2 hard-drives (so that I can stuff 400 GB mosters in it) with wi-fi/ethernet/usb interfaces and some software inside so that it can serve as a drive for my computer via wi-fi. I would put it in a closet and finally have a backup storage that can be used by all my computers and will survive the upgrades of my main computer. 

I'm willing to pay $200 (just for the enclosure, I would still have to shop for some big 400 GB hard-drive, but the total cost should be less than $1k, and dropping every day).

I know that products like that are slowly showing up but usually they come short (very, very short) in terms of size. Like giving 160 GB. 160 GB? I want 1 Terabyte!

I know they'll come. I just need to be patient.
