Title: How to make an app.

<b>How to make an app.</b> Brent describes <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/04/10.php">his plan</a> for creating small apps. Shortened:
<ul>
  <li> define precisely what the app does
  <li> sketch UI on paper
  <li> sketch UI in Interface Builder (that's a Mac OS X RAD-type tool, for those stuck exclusively in Windows)
  <li> write list of milestones (each milestone should be small)
  <li> do the milestones, one by one
</ul>
Finishing things is the hardest things.
