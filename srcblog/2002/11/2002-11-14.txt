Title: Tablet PC

<b>Tablet PC.</b> Dan Bricklin tells us <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/tabletpc.htm">his impressions</a> after using Tablet PC. He likes it. I think I like it too - they look cool. I want one but I'm not going to be getting it anytime soon. Tablet PCs are expensive and I'm way over my gadget-oriented budget.
