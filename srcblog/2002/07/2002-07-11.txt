Title: Laws of marketing #11 (perspective)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: marketing effects take place over an extended period 
of time. It's a mistake to sacrifice long-term planning with actions 
to improve short-term balance sheet. E.g. sales increase short-term 
profits but in long-term educates people to not buy for regular 
price, therefore decreasing long-term profits.
