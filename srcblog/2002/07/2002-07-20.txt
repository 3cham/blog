Title: Pepper, your friendly text editor

<B>Pepper, your friendly text editor</B> &#013;&#010;<P/>I've been playing with a new, programmer-oriented text editor called <A href="http://www.hekkelman.com/pepper.html">Pepper</A>. And I like it so far - to the point that it'll probably become my default editor for a while.&#013;&#010;<P/>The interesting thing is that apparently one can still earn some money in a tiny software business (from the looks of it,&nbsp;Pepper's author is just one guy working after hours) and in a most crowded, unimaginative category of software you can imagine. After all, what can be more un-innovative than a text editor (file managers (especially those Norton Commander clones) come close) ? Yet I did register it ($55 for one person, multi-platform (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux) edition, it would be only $35 for one person, one platform). I've tried tons of text editors in the past, many of them available for free. I used Emacs a lot (and still usually configure other editors to Emacs-like keybinding), which is much more powerful that Pepper. I've recently tried a few free, open-source editors (SciTech, AnyEdit) but Pepper seduced me with its elegance and simplicity. There's something powerful about having "just the right" set of features without the clutter. Of course there are a few features I would like it to have (spell-checking is something I miss the most) but having a perfect editor will have to wait until I write one.&#013;&#010;<P/>I will keep doing my C/C++ coding in <A href="http://www.sourcedyn.com/">Source Insight</A>, truly the most powerful programmer's editor and a life-saver on big projects (when you count the number of lines in hundreds of thousands), but Pepper is my favorite for editing text files, small HTML documents or small Python/Perl scripts.</P>&#013;&#010;<P><I>(Accidentally I just discovered that there is another, completely unrelated <A href="http://www.r-objects.com/">Pepper</A> (Pepper Personal Knowledge Manager). Boy, are Java-based GUI apps ugly).</I>
