Title: Laws of marketing #2 (category)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: given that it's very hard to gain leadership in a 
category where competition already exists, it's better to create a 
product in new category than trying to attack existing categories. 
<p>
Category doesn't have to be radically different, e.g. if there's 
dominant player in imported beer, one can become the first to import 
light beer. If one can't be the first to fly over Atlantic, one can 
still be the first woman to fly over Atlantic.
