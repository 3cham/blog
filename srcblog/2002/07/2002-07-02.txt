Title: I saw two movies recently...

I saw two movies recently: "Minority Report" and "Bourne Identity". They have few things in common: &#013;&#010;<UL>&#013;&#010;<LI>they're good &#013;&#010;<LI>they're blockbusters &#013;&#010;<LI>they're based on a book ("Bourne Identity")/story ("Minority Report") &#013;&#010;<LI>they have little in common with the original stories </LI></UL>I've read "Bourne Identity" a long time ago and the movie shares only the basics of the plot (a trained-to-kill special agent, his amnesia and his newly met female companion) with the movie. Given that I'm a big fan of P. K. Dick (insane author of "Minority Report") after seeing a movie a went to bookstore to read his short story on which the movie was based and the story repeats: the similarity is rather superficial. &#013;&#010;<P>On one hand I find this disfigurement hard to swallow. On the other hand the voice of reason (in those rare moments when it bothers to visit me) tells me that the movies are probably better for it. You can't really make a good movie that would be literally based on anything that P. K. Dick wrote - there's a reason he remained respected but largely unknown SF writer.
