Title: Philip Greenspun is unique among...

Philip Greenspun is unique among those who write about programming in that he doesn't confine himself to writing about the nitty-gritty details of technologies but occasionally writes about subjects that go beyond that. In <A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010604035443/www.arsdigita.com/asj/professionalism">Redefining Professionalism for Software Engineers</A> he wrote about the professionalism as applied to Software Engineers. The history of this article is interesting - it first appeared in ArsDigita Systems Journal, an ambitious (but failed) project at Greenspun's ambitious (and also failed) company. At some point it must have been considered too controversial since it has been unlinked from ASJ's index. Today ArsDigita and the whole ASJ is gone but we can still enjoy it thanks to the wonderful <A href="http://web.archive.org/">web archive</A>.
