Title: Laws of marketing #12 (line extension)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: there's an irresistible pressure to extend the equity 
of the brand and it's a mistake. Instead one should create new brands 
to address new markets/products.
<P><I>My comment: in this chapter authors predict (in 1993) that 
Microsoft will fail because they use this unhealthy strategy of 
extending their brand to new products. 9 years later and Microsoft is 
still going strong. Looks like the law doesn't hold universally.</I></p>
