Title: Learn C++ in 10 minutes.
Draft: 1

While browsing the shelves at Borders I saw <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672324253/">this amazing book</A> that promises to teach you C++ in 10 minutes. That's an improvement over 21 days, a previously held record for teaching C++ by the book, and a very sad comment about my intellectual abilities (took me years). Peter Norvig's excellent essay <A href="http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</A> is the best possible commentary.
