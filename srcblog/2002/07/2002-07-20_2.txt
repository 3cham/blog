Title: Apple to turn x86.
Draft: 1

<B>Apple to turn x86.</B> Rumors are flying that Apple will switch to x86 and my prediction (which might turn out to be wrong; it's a prediction after all) is that they will. Sooner or later they'll have to because PowerPC cannot keep up with the volume and speed of improvement done to x86 architecture. Motorola (one of the makers of PowerPC chips) is in trouble. Apple cannot afford to be like SUN and work on chips as well. They would be spreading themselves too thin. So they'll port. And it's going to be tough, but tough is Apple's middle name. They already switched processor once, they know the drill. PowerPC will have the same problem as MC68xxx had (unable to compete with Intel's endurance despite having much better architecture; in the beauty vs. beast contest beast won). This time around there is no viable alternative to x86 and whatever will replace it (since 64-bit is inevitable) will have to have emulation built-in (AMD's McHammer or Intel's whatever-it's-called-this week). <P/>&#013;&#010;<P>What will that mean? Many angry Mac users that will have even less reasons to feel special. Apple finally catching with PC's price-to-value ratio. More Unix people converting to Mac OS X. Microsoft stops developing for Mac - Mac-on-PowerPC is not a threat, Mac-on-x86 would be too much.
