Title: &#01...

&#013;&#010;The book says: marketing strategy depends on your position in the market. If you're No. 2&#013;&#010;you use different strategy than when you're No. 1 or 3. Avis was No. 2 in&#013;&#010;car rental and when they advertised as "finest in rent-a-cars" the had losses&#013;&#010;because their marketing wasn't credible (you can't be "finest" being No. 2).&#013;&#010;That had profit when they switched to "Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why&#013;&#010;go with us? We try harder". Then they had another disastrous campaign when&#013;&#010;they started claiming "Avis is going to be No. 1".&#013;&#010;<p>&#013;&#010;<i>&#013;&#010;My comment: I agree with the premise (kind of marketing depends on your position in&#013;&#010;the market). However the book says very little about what kind of strategy&#013;&#010;one should use in a given position (except for a few examples). Additionally &#013;&#010;their examples feel like they oversimplify complex reality. Even assuming&#013;&#010;that the data about e.g. Avis is fully correct (i.e. that there is strong&#013;&#010;correlation between Avis profits and the kind of marketing campaign)&#013;&#010;I find it hardly unlikely that there's a causality relationship.&#013;&#010;I don't think that good or bad marketing champaign can make or break a company.&#013;&#010;I can see how this point of view can be attractive for marketing people but&#013;&#010;I would think that success depends on more factors. Marketing might be&#013;&#010;an important factor but certainly not dominant.&#013;&#010;</i>&#013;&#010;
