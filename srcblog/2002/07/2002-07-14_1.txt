Title: Then I realized that I...

Then I realized that I don't have any of those hardware conflicts problems on laptops (which is why I use laptops more often those days). But laptops are expensive (especially those that I like to use). This thing is something between: small, quiet (I presume) yet fast as the best of them. More expensive than a comparable desktop but less expensive than a comparable laptop. A year ago they didn't have a model powerful enough for my taste but their latest model is more than I need. I would stuff it with 1 GB (or more) of memory, add another HD to make it RAID'able and feel very happy for a few days after buying it. And I would throw in a 1600x1200 LCD monitor for a good measure. I would be in geek heaven.
