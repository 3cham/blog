Title: Spam, even more of it.

<B>Spam, even more of it.</B> <A href="http://127.0.0.1:5335/groups.yahoo.com">Yahoo!Groups</A> were relatively (if not completely) spam free. That was because spammers went for the lowest hanging fruit - blindly harvesting e-mail addresses from web pages. To send an e-mail to a Yahoo! group you first need to subscribe. Technically it's not hard to write a program to do it automatically and spam the group anyway&nbsp;but it looks like until recently it was hard enough or not interesting enough for the spammers. I just noticed that this is no longer true - I see an increasing number of spam messages on Yahoo! groups posted from clearly bogus e-mail addresses. It's easier to fight because (at least theoretically) one can block a spammer but there's nothing to stop him to re-subscribe with a different bogus e-mail address. This is an arm race and it's hard to see how we can fight spam effectively. For every technical trick to block spammers, they'll find a technical trick to overcome the block. Some even predict that at some point the increase of spam will make e-mail unusable. Do we need more than <A href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">this plan</A>?
