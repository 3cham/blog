Look like learning them will require some time investments. I was delighted that I can open *.swf files. I figured out I could learn tricks by inspecting existing flash animations. I wasn't delighted when I discovered that *.swf files can be protected and Flash MX refused to open the first animation I tried. But Google made me lucky very quickly, there are tools to unprotect flash, e.g. <A href="http://www.flashtoolset.com/FTS/features.html">Flash Toolset</A>. Exploration begins..
