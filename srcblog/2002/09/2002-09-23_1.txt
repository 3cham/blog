Title: No money in content.

<b>No  money in content.</b> <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/000161.html">I wrote</a> that there's no money in blogging. <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/website/view.cgi?dbs=Article&key=1029950348&format=full">
This article</a> is much more extensive treatise on why there isn't much money in on-line content. It features Economics 101 and shares my point of view that in order to have a business, there must be scarcity and there's hardly a scarcity in the on-line content area.
