Title: Multimedia need not apply.

<b>Multimedia need not apply.</b> <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1033-958903.html">This idea</a> is so wrong. Why is anyone pushing video for cell phones is beyond me. First of all the bandwidth isn't there and won't be there for years to come. Currently we can't even get wireless speeds that allow comfortable web browsing. Second, no one really wants that. There must be some mass delusion going on among wireless carriers/equipment makers, one that rivals WAP delusion. They invest money in services that they <i>think</i> might be popular but have exactly zero data to confirm that. It's all wishful thinking. And why would anyone want to watch video on a smallish screen? Everybody already has a TV and that's much better technology for watching moving pictures. And on top of that there is no content and who's going to break the chicken-and-egg spell? No market - no content. No content - no market.
