Title: Ideas are worthless.

<B>Ideas are worthless.</B> I really have a problem with people who either think that they are so great just because they've come up with an idea or people who think that a great idea is a pre-requisite for a successfully program/business/you-name-it. So I'm not going to pass up the chance to link to someone, who <A href="http://www.pycs.net/workbench/2002/09/06.html#a354">shares my POV</A>: &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Ideas are easy. Books are hard. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>So please, repeat after me: ideas are easy; it's the execution that matters. God is in the details.
