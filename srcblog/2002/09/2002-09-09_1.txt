Title: Give a spammer bad address.

<B>Give a spammer bad address.</B> Just found <A href="http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/2002/08/24.html">this idea</A>: put on your web pages bogus e-mail addresses. They will be harvested by spammers and will clog their address books. Nice, distributed idea although I don't think it'll work. It doesn't decrease the number of valid addresses that spammers have. There is no limit to how much addresses a spammer can keep (a 60 GB drive will store a lot of addresses), there really is no limit to how many e-mails they can send (it costs them next to nothing to send a piece of spam and not much more to send million of e-mails) and if worst comes they can easily mark as invalid all addresses that bounce e-mails (although when they start doing that, they'll have to expose a real e-mail address that can then be flooded and additionally one will be able to remove itself from the spammer's list by faking bouncing a message; I was doing that for some time (because <A href="http://www.fastmail.fm/">fastmail.fm</A> makes faking bouncing messages as easy as deleting them) but stopped since I didn't notice any decrease in spam). I don't like legislative solutions but I begin to think that anti-spam legislation is the only way to stop this madness. But then again I don't think it would stop&nbsp;spam from Korea.
