Title: Net words.

<b>Net Words.</b> Finished reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0071380396/">
Net Words: Creating High-Impact Online Copy</a>. Overall, I'm disappointed. Too much talk about why good copy is
important, not enough practical tips on how to create a good copy. So let me quote the good part, 3 examples
of a good copy. A sign in a beach in California:
<blockquote><i>
So that others may enjoy our fragile tidepools and kelp forests,
please take only photographs, leave only footprints.
</i></blockquote>
Headstone on a tombstone of a station agent in the cowboy days of the 1880s:
<blockquote><i>
Here lies Lester Moore<br>
Four slugs from a .44<br>
No Les No More.
</i></blockquote>
Or what do they have in some gym instead of "Authorized Personnel Only" signs:
<blockquote><i>
Staff Only.<br>
Don't feel left out.<br>
Please apply at the front desk.<br>
</i></blockquote>
I quote them because they show that, with a little bit of love,
one can go above avarage and that wisdom applies not only to copywriting.
