Title: Arms race is good for you.

<b>Arms race is good for you.</b>. <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/27#whatAboutPatents">Dave says</a> that if he had a great idea he would patent it. His argument is simple and plays on people's fear and greed: they're doing it, if I don't do it, I'm going to loose. I'm going to be a chump. The same selfish, fear-induced thinking is a reason for arms race: they got guns, if we don't make our own guns, we're going to loose. But the problem with arms race is that it never stops and when it finally comes to using the guns, everybody looses (even those who, in the meantime, got rich selling guns). It's true that the underlying reason for this mess is extremely bad patent system but by accepting the mess as necessity and playing along people reinfornce the system. What you do matters. Think about.
