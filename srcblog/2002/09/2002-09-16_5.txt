Title: Rackshack.net is the winner

<b>Rackshack.net is the winner</b>. I wrote about the hosting company <a href="http://www.rackshack.net">Rackshack</a> before, praising them for their cluefullness. Looks like being clueful pays off. According to <a href="http://www.rds.com/doug/weblogs/2002/08/20.html">those stats</a>, they are the fastest growing web hoster. Good for them. And they're cheap too.
