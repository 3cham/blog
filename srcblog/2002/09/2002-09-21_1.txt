Title: SonyEricsson doesn't get it.

Sony Ericsson is a venture of, you guessed it, Sony and Ericsson. They
are about to release a cool phone named P800. <a
href="http://www.theregus.com">The Register</a> gave it <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/25054.html">an enthusiastic
review</a> (something that doesn't happen often there). But it seems
that they failed to read Joel's <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Platforms.html">article
about platform</a>.
<p/>
A phone like this is a platform - plain and simple, the same way as
Palm OS or Pocket PC is a platform. P800 is based on the latest
version 7 of Symbian OS. Functionality wise Symbian OS is on par with
Palm OS and Pocket PC. It's being developed for a long time but didn't
gain the same momentum as Palm or Pocket PC, mostly due to Psion's
(the original developer of Symbian OS) failure to produce a compelling
PDA based on it. The result of this is that Palm has
literally thousands of applications available for its devices, Pocket
PC much less (but steadily gaining) and Symbian OS is a very distant
third. And applications matter a lot. Applications sell the
devices. SonyEricsson seems to grasp at least that much since they
launched <a
href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/codetocash/">CodeToCash</a>
competition. Rules are simple: you make an app, you submit the app,
you get money if you win. But they immediately shoot themselves in the
foot. Badly. First of all the prizes are very small: top 3 get a PC
($3000 worth) and top 50 get the phone itself (estimated $800 but of
course the cost to SE is a fraction of that) and Metrowerks
Codewarrior dev tools ($1000, , $0 cost to Metrowerks). But here's the
catch: in order to enter the competition you need to sign up for basic
developer support (which will cost you $500) and pay $1000 (I guess,
Metrowerks doesn't even list the price on <a
href="http://www.metrowerksstore.com/symbiand4.html">their web
page</a>) for Metrowerks Codewarrior tools because this is the only
way so far to develop for Symbian 7.
<p/>
I have many questions, most important being: how stupid can you get?
First, what is the value of winning free Metrowerks tools if you have
to purchase them anyway to even enter the competition? The whole thing
doesn't look like a genuine attempt to promote the platform but almost
like a scam to get money from the developers. They'll actually make
money if more than 50 people enter the competition (in which I highly
doubt). It's a guaranteed income for Metrowerks (assuming anyone will
be stupid enough to play along). I wasn't too surprised when I found
out that the web page is powered by Metrowerks (at some point one link
was broken and resolved to Metrowerks domain).
<p/>Here's a message to SonyEricsson: you have to do much
better. You're late to the market, both Palm and Microsoft offer free
development tools (although Palm starts making the same mistake by
more closely "partnering" with Metrowerks which manifests itself mostly by
Palm not supporting free toolchain in their latest OS 5 SDK). It
stands to a reason that in a market where you're a distant third you
should do everything better than the first two players. Cool phone is
not enough (especially if it costs $800). To add insult to the injury
all previous versions of Symbian OS had a free development tools (gcc
toolchain that was probably ported by Cygnus (now RedHat) to ARM
processor). There <a
href="http://www.theregus.com/content/54/26048.html">are signs</a>
that SonyEricsson is coming to its senses and will provide free tools sometime
in the future. But that's going to be too little too late. It's not
like you don't have fierce competition, guys. Wake up.
