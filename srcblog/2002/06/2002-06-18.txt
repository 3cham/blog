Title: What do they do again...

What do they do again? They evolve their service yet another time, this time providing Gold Box (look in the right-upper corner). The idea itself is neat but not revolutionary. But Amazon is great because it adds those neat ideas all the time and they add up in the end to one of the best e-commerce sites on the planet. <A href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/blog/sethgodin.html">Seth Godin</A> also noticed Gold Box.
