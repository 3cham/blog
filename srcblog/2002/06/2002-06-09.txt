Title: There are evil reasons to...

There are evil reasons to use packet capturing programs but there are also legitimate ones, like learning protocols and debugging web applications. For example today I was trying to write python script to grab a main page for <A href="http://groups.yahoo.com">Yahoo!Groups</A> but Yahoo was rudely responding with 302. So I captured the traffic for the same page generated by Mozilla, looked at HTTP request it sends, compared with what my script sends, modified the script to send something similiar and voila! The thing worked. &#013;&#010;<P>There are two Windows programs I know to capture packets: <A href="http://www.ethereal.com/">Ethereal</A> (which is a cross-platform tool based on Gtk+, which is a reason for it looking so ugly on Windows) and <A href="http://analyzer.polito.it">Analyzer</A>. They are both free and based on <A href="http://winpcap.polito.it">WinPcap</A> library. Ethereal is open-source and Analyzer public-domain but the source is not publically available (although it seems you can get it if you're willing to work on it).&#013;&#010;<P>In short, Analyzer looks much better but Ethereal has a crucial (for me) feature: it can reconstruct the TCP/IP stream (i.e. I can easily see the whole exchange between HTTP client and server) while in Analyzer I can only inspect single packets. &#013;&#010;<P>The conclusion I had was that the UI of those programs could be greately improved but that's a story for another day.
