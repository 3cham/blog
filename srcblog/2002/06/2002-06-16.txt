Title: Just finished "Renegades of the empire"

Just finished reading the book "Renegades of the empire". Fascinating story about how DirectX (multimedia technology from Microsoft) came to be. The story is centered around three key people who worked hard to get it done and evangelize. It paints a very interesting picture of how things work inside Microsoft - that it's not a united machine all marching in one direction but that internal fights and competition is as intense as Microsoft's competition with other firms.
