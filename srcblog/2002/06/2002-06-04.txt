Title: Lame Pocket PC.

<STRONG>Lame Pocket PC.</STRONG></P>&#013;&#010;<P><BR>I can't believe how lame Pocket PC is compared to Palm. I just achieved high level of frustration doing a very simple thing and need to vent a bit. So here it goes...<BR></P>&#013;&#010;<P>All I wanted to do was to listen to some mp3 on my iPAQ with 256 MB CF card. That's going to be a piece of cake, I say to myself. I copy my mp3s to CF card, insert the card, go to Windows media player and try to play them. Media player doesn't see them. So I go to file manager, click on the file in it, that switches me to Media Player... but it still doesn't play the audio. Hmm, I say to myself. After considerable intellectual exercise I have a vague impression that Pocket PC software usually doesn't see files unless they're in "My documents" folder (and my mp3s were in root directory). So I create "My documents" folder, move mp3s there, switch to Media Player. It still doesn't see them. I press random buttons and finally, I hear my mp3s being played. What a relief.<BR>So I play it, pause in the middle and switch off my iPAQ. Then I turn it on and... Media Player flashes a few times as if confused and starts playing my mp3 from the beginning, not from the place where I paused it. For me it's a big freaking deal because the mp3 is not a 3 minutes song but a 43 minutes spoken audio. And of course there are no bookmarks so I can't even work-around software's idiocy. It's so bad that one wonders whether it was designed and programmed by 10 year olds or a multi-billion software company hiring the best of the best.<BR></P>&#013;&#010;<P>The only good thing one can say about Pocket PC is that Palms (with the exception of latest CLIEs) cannot play mp3s at all.
