Title: CVS, Windows and binary files

Today I've been bitten again by how CVS handles binary files under 
Windows. When you ever see a binary file being corrupted when you 
update your local repository on a Windows machine you should mark the 
file as binary, delete it locally and re-update. There are two ways 
to do it:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>cvs add -kb filename</CODE> when you add the file initially to the project</LI>
<LI><CODE>cvs admin -kb filename</CODE> after the fact</LI>
</UL>
You can learn this and much more by reading this free, on-line book
