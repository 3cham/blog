Title: Low resolution LCD

<STRONG>Low resolution LCD</STRONG></P>&#013;&#010;<P>I just don't get it. My laptop has 14 inch LCD and a resolution of 1400x1050. There are laptops with 15 inch LCD and a resolution of 1600x1200. I have yet to find a stand-alone 17 inch LCD with a resolution greater than 1280x1024 or 15 inch LCD with resolution greater 1024x768. Why is that? I would love to replace my clunky, big, heavy and hard-to-setup-correctly 21 inch monitor with an LCD but after working in 1600x1200 I just can't go back to 1280x1024. Give me a high-resolution or give me death! I will pay, I promise!
