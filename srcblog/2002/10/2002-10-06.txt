Title: High-level not so good.

<b>High-level not so good.</b>There goes the theory of superiority of high-level languages. Second prize 
  in <a href="http://icfpcontest.cse.ogi.edu/">Fifth ICFP Programming Contest</a> 
  went to a program written in C. That pretty much settles the question that doesn't 
  seem to to get off people's mind: are high-level languages better for writing 
  software (where high-level means "higher level than C")? One might think that 
  the fact that the winning entry was in Objective Caml proves that high-level 
  programming languages are indeed better but the important statistic here is 
  that entry in C was better than a lot of other entries written in Python, Lisp, 
  Java, Haskell, OCaml etc. And here's my revelation: it's not the language, it's 
  the programmer.
