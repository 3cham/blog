Title: A different view.

<b>A different view.</b> Posting about Amazon Light reminded me about a similar (in the spirit) site that I use very frequently: <a href="http://www.alterslash.org/">AlterSlash</a> (unofficial <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">SlashDot</a> digest, as they call themselves). There are many ways to present the same data/service. However different designs are very rarely tried. Big sites like Yahoo, Google or Amazon try different things but with the intent of adopting changes that work best for them. Smaller sites don't have the resources/desire to try different designs - this would become a costly hobby. Additionally it's very hard for 3rd parties to try this game since it requires a messy and brittle screen-scrapping (i.e. extracting data from html) to do the job (although web services promise, without yet delivering, to ease such developements). This is sad since there is a possibility that a different design would be better (as AlterSlash is much better for me than Slashdot: after long time of reading Slashdot I switched to AlterSlash almost exclusively). This actually might become an issue in the future since wireless mobile devices that are slowly starting to appear require much different web page design in order to make web pages usable and we don't have an infrustructure for creating web pages with different designs easily (which is not a surprise because that was not a problem in the past).
