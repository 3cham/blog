Title: Ray's vision.

<b>Ray's vision.</b> Ray Ozzie <a href="http://www.ozzie.net/blog/stories/2002/10/01/marketOpportunity.html">has posted</a> a document that was "founding document" for Groove. Ray is the guy who created Lotus Notes and is now creating Groove. I'm fascinated by documents like this, they give a little peak into how great minds work.
