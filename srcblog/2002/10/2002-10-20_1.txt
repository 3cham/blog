Title: Mitch Kapor strikes again

<b>Mitch Kapor strikes again.</b> Or at least is planning to strike again. 
  Mitch is a pioneer in the software business, he designed Lotus 1-2-3 and Lotus 
  Agenda. Now he has a <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/">weblog</a> 
  in which <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000007.html#000007">he 
  reveals his plans for the future</a>. In short - he's planning to <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">write 
  a PIM</a> (Personal Information Manager). There are a couple of things that 
  make this project interesting despite the &quot;we're still thinking&quot; status 
  of it. First it's going to be open source. Now, most open source projects fail 
  to produce anything useful (don't blame me, blame SourceForge) but this one 
  might just be different. There are few good signs. The project is driven by 
  Mitch Kapor. He knows how to make and ship succesful software. He did it, so 
  he's not likely to delude himself into underestimating the effor required (and 
  a lot of people underestimate how hard making software is). He also has a lot 
  of experience with PIMs (the aforementioned Agenda that he designed was a PIM). 
  He's also not deluding himself about making money from the project (I suspect 
  he's already a wealthy man and is in a position where his personal goals are 
  more important that making another buck). It's also going to be interesting 
  to see if they manage to write a really good application in a cross-platform 
  GUI library. GUI programming is hard both technically and conceptually. Windows 
  and MacOS ship with a good set of basic widgets but to provide what the most 
  polished commercial applications provide (latest products from Microsoft or 
  Adobe or Macromedia) requires a lot of effort. Historically cross-platform GUI 
  libraries didn't provide enough for the apps to compete with fully native apps. 
  The conclusion: this project is worth watching.
