Title: Vista prototype.

<strong>Vista prototype</strong>. <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org">OSAF</a> 
  just published <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/Vista_prototype.htm">a 
  description</a> of the prototype of their future PIM. The interesting thing 
  is how good it looks given that the GUI has been written in TK. Most of the 
  apps I've seen so far that used TK didn't look good, especially on Windows, 
  where the native gadgets look much different. I guess that means that talent 
  is more important that the tool. It's going to be interesting to see what they'll 
  achieve in wxWindows.
