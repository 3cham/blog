Title: Embedded failure.

<b>Embedded failure.</b> Slashdot reports on <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/04/0244221">release 
of wxEmbedded</a>. More information in <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4064800316.html">this 
article.</a> I can't help thinking about how bad this approach is. Look at the 
screenshots - they just show desktop apps squeezed into smaller resolution. Apparently 
the authors think that this is an engineering challenge: how to shrink software 
that uses a lot of memory so that it can fit on a device with little memory. Other 
than that they use the same widgets, the same visual design as desktop version. 
And they would even probably defend this approach because &quot;it makes the porting 
easy&quot;. It's the same approach that TrollTech has chosen with their <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/">QTopia</a> 
port of Qt GUI toolkit. Microsoft already learned that lesson the hard way - you 
can't just port a desktop GUI to a PDA. It'll be painful to use. Latest version 
of Pocket PC OS has many enhancements that make it a better fit for a PDA device. 
To me doing an OS for a PDA is more a design issue than implementation issue. 
Designing something that works well in the constrained environment of a PDA is 
hard. Implementation, on the other hand, is easy because, by definition, this 
hardware won't run large pieces of software. People behind wxEmbedded didn't learn 
yet what's important on mobile devices. They might keep coding away at their embedded 
GUI but as long as they neglect the hardest problem - designing UI good for mobile 
devices - and keep producing something that is inferior to what's already available, 
they'll fail.
