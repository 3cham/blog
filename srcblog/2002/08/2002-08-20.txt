Title: Here's why it won...

Here's why it won't work. If people wanted to send you sounds wouldn't they just call you instead of sending a message? And where will they get those sounds and images in the first place? Built-in cameras are just a novelty. The quality is terrible, it will never match even the simplest digital cameras. This thing will wear thinly very fast. &#013;&#010;<P>But here's the main reason: competition. SMS is crappy, over-priced service. The willingness to pay for it is a result of lack of alternatives, not the greatness of the service. But here come <A href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">Sidekick and Pocket PC Phones</A> and the SMS looks like Ford T next to a BMW. You're not in Kansas anymore, guys. No more charging me per letter sent. Now I have e-mail, IM, web browsing. If you want my money give me unlimited data transfer for a reasonable price. Then I'll subscribe to your plan.
