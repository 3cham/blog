Title: Sidekick coming up.
Draft: 1

<A href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20020808.html">Walt:</A> &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE><I>One of the problems with all the exciting new hand-held wireless devices on the market is that they cost a lot to buy and use. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>Amen, brother. The rest of the article is a review of upcoming Sidekick wireless gizmo. It mentions October as a launching date, $199 for the device and $39.99/month for unlimited data access and some phone minutes. This is a price I could stomach. I wonder if the plan for Pocket PC Phone edition devices will get cheaper as well.
