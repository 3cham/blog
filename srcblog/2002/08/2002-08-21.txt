Title: Good writing.

<B>Good writing.</B> Good writing is the basis for weblogging. Good books about how to write learn are <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060006641/">On writing well</A> and <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226899152/">Style: toward clarity and grace</A>. If you don't feel like reading books, this list might help as well: &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE>&#013;&#010;<UL>&#013;&#010;<LI>Avoid alliteration. &#013;&#010;<LI>Prepositions dangle awkwardly if you use them to end sentences with. &#013;&#010;<LI>Avoid clich&#233;s and colloquialisms like the plague, or you will seem old hat. &#013;&#010;<LI>Employ the vernacular, while eschewing arcane and obfuscatory verbiage. &#013;&#010;<LI>Avoid ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc. &#013;&#010;<LI>Take it easy with parenthetical remarks (however relevant), to avoid chopping up sentences (unnecessarily (we might add)). &#013;&#010;<LI>To ever, however artfully, split an infinitive, marks you as grammatically challenged. &#013;&#010;<LI>Skip the foreign words and phrases you know, n&#146;est-ce pas? &#013;&#010;<LI>Never generalize. &#013;&#010;<LI>&#147;I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.&#148; &#150;Ralph Waldo Emerson &#013;&#010;<LI>Comparisons can clog up writing as badly as alliterations and cliches. &#013;&#010;<LI>Avoid redundancy and verbosity, or readers will think you are repeating yourself and using too many words as well besides. &#013;&#010;<LI>We really get @*&amp;%$**)!! when you use vulgarities. &#013;&#010;<LI>Clear, specific writing beats vagueness, we suppose. Whatever. &#013;&#010;<LI>Overstatement totally destroys any credibility you ever had forever. &#013;&#010;<LI>Understatement can, at times, perhaps shade a point to the point of its fading away. &#013;&#010;<LI>One word sentences? Eliminate. &#013;&#010;<LI>Analogies work about as well as fur on a flounder. &#013;&#010;<LI>&#147;Is&#148; just sits there. Pick verbs that do something. &#013;&#010;<LI>Even if a mixed metaphor sings, you should derail it. &#013;&#010;<LI>Who needs rhetorical questions? &#013;&#010;<LI>Its distrakting too punctuat, an spel rong. </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Good writing is surprisingly hard.
