Title: Programmers and empathy.

If you're a programmer/hacker/geek, it's worth reading (and even re-reading) the talk <A href="http://www.petdance.com/perl/geek-culture/">Geek Culture Considered Harmful to Perl</A>. The main point I see in this talk is not limited to Perl. The author quotes <A href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/Personality-Characteristics.html">The Jargon File</A>: <I>"[h]ackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with other people"</I>. If you're not like that, if you have high levels of empathy, great. But the level of empathy could always be increased and realizing that there is a problem (and we have ample evidence that there is in the amount of rudeness going on on mailing list and boards, esp. where people can post anonymously) is a first step. The second step is trying not to be rude - it can be learned.
