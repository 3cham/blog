Title: Where the Gods fight...

<B>Where the Gods fight...</B>. A <A href="http://sagewire.sage.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/23/1453236">e-mail discussion</A> between John Gilmore and Jon "maddog" Hall about .ORG bids. A few low points where they try to prove to each other whose is bigger (now I understand why penis enlargement isn't popular with geeks; who needs a pill if you can grow 3 inches with just a well-crafted put-down) but otherwise an excellent read. I found out that I can buy domain for $12/year at <A href="http://joker.com/">Joker.com</A> (I'm one of those chumps overpaying $35/year using register.com and easydns.com; which just proves that markets (consumers) are far from well-informed and efficient (the economic theory goes that in well-informed, efficient markets all prices will go down to barely make a profit).
