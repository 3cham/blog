Title: Performance, profiles.

<B>Performance, profiles.</B> Some info about performance (in the context of programming languages) on <A href="http://openmap.bbn.com/~kanderso/performance/">this page</A>. Main take away is that there are 3 ways to get good performance: profile, profile, profile. Sadly, I don't know any good profilers (notice "good").
