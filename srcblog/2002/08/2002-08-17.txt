Title: Good book hunting.

I've calculated how much I've spent recently on computer books from O'Reilly. The total was $313. O'Reilly has an interesting <A href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">on-line library</A>. I just realized that 15 points subscription (i.e. where you can read approximately 15 books at the same time) is $19.99/month which is $239.88. Costs less and I could read way more books. Of course&nbsp;nothing is perfect. I'm restricted&nbsp;to reading Safari books&nbsp;in places where I have a computer with Internet connection. Reading on paper is better. When I stop subscription, all my books&nbsp;will go&nbsp;away. But there are benefits. It's much easier to copy/paste a piece of code from HTML than re-type it from a book. Also it's easier to get a new book when something unexpected happens. I was at work, trying for the first time dabble in ASP.NET. Since I didn't anticipate it, I didn't have any book and was stuck with MSDN documentation and Google. It would be so much easier to go to Safari, add&nbsp;one of the books on ASP.NET to my subscription and get all my answers there. There are 844 books to choose from. The bottom line is: I'm on a trial (14 days for free) subscription. Will probably continue and see how it goes.
