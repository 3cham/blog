Title: Pepper no more.

<B>Pepper no more.</B> I've&nbsp;recently&nbsp;mentioned Pepper (a text editor). Well, <A href="http://www.hekkelman.com/">Pepper is no more</A>: &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE><I>End of story &#013;&#010;<P>I'm no longer taking orders for my software. &#013;&#010;<P>Thanks to all who supported me and my software over the last years. I had a great time, esp. in the beginning. However, recent changes in the various OS's and several not so nice experiences with less than honest 'clients' combined with negative feedback on my software have forced me to stop. &#013;&#010;<P></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Oh well, back to Emacs for me. The life goes on. Wouldn't that be a good case to release source code? Assuming that the author can't profit from the source code, why not slap it on the sourceforge and let the software live? Similar to what will happen to <A href="http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1520">gobeProductive</A> (gobeProductive is an office suite that started life on BeOS (created by people involved in Apple Works (used to be Claris Works) and when BeOS was dismissed (there's not enough oxygen in the OS space) the company made an attempt at Windows port, but failed (there's not enough oxygen in the office suite space)).
