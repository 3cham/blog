Title: Gadget lust.

<B>Gadget lust.</B> I want <A href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond100/">Nikon D100</A>. And I want it now. A 6 megapixel, $2000 digital camera. I don't really need one and I already have Nikon Coolpix 995 (which I don't use much) but when the logic and lust battle, the logic always looses.
