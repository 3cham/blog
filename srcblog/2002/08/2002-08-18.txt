Title: What I need.

<B>What I need.</B> What would be great to have is a ssh/sftp file system driver for Windows. Currently to exchange files between my servers running ssh and my primary Windows machine I use <A href="http://winscp.vse.cz/eng/">WinSCP</A>, and for remote access I use <A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</A> (both programs are free). &#013;&#010;<P>What would be even more useful is an ability to mount the filesystem of a remote machine into a drive on Windows. Technically it's possible. Some operations (changing small parts of the file) would probably suck because I don't think the protocol supports&nbsp;the full i/o sementics&nbsp;so the filesystem driver would have to cache the file locally and every change would require writing the whole file out. It would still work great for file copying (and I could use any app I want&nbsp;for that and not be limited by what WinSCP can do) and editing remote files.
