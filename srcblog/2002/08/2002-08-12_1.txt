Title: The value of programming.

<B>The value of programming.</B> I'm a programmer so <A href="http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?mmp:7790">this post</A> was at first hard to swallow: &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Ah, well, I think the market in my profession is working just fine. I'm grossly overpaid compared to people who do work which I think has more intrinsic value (e.g., teachers, nurses, nannies, research professors, social activists) (and, no, I don't confuse my notions of intrinsic value with market value, just as I hope that nobody is confused enough to think that market value is the same as intrinsic value). And even at my pay scale I still have time to read mailing lists and do some free software work. When I spread money around, I sure as heck don't give it to people in my profession. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>But after some reflection I can't help but agree. We (programmers) are just lucky bustards. There's <A href="http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?msn:7705:fhhnpeaonhppkeodanan>">another post</A> presenting similar perspective. Both posts come from a Free Software Business <A href="http://www.crynwr.com/fsb/">mailing list</A>. Don't expect to find there a receipt on how to make money on free/open source software (we're still waiting for The One who will figure out&nbsp;a reproducible way to do that). Expect intelligent people engaging in interesting conversations.
