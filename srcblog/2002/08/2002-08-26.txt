Title: More on aggregation.

<B>More on aggregation.</B> <A href="http://paolo.evectors.it/">Paolo</A> makes <A href="http://paolo.evectors.it/stories/newsAggregators.html">good points</A> about search engines and RSS aggregation. I agree than having RSS news aggregators is better than not having them at all. But we can do better and Paolo has some ideas. Additionally, I think that we should go beyond RSS. The idea is very sketchy, but the gist of it is: RSS should only be one source of information. What would other sources be? I don't know. Maybe periodically re-run Google query that alerts you to new pages for your query?&nbsp;(but the really beatuful part here is that I can have exchange of ideas with someone living in Italy. Awesome.)
