Title: A battle for better copyright terms.

<b>A battle for better copyright terms.</b> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,110419,00.asp">This</a> is really significant. O'Reilly is putting his (their) money where the mouth is: in order to promote shorter copyright terms than the ridiculous life+70 years currently automatically awarded by U.S. thanks to legislation funded by Mickey Mouse profits. O'Reilly will volountarily limit the copyright term of their books to 14 years (some limitations apply) which is how long the first, original copyright term was. This is good because legislation can be changed. It can be changed by money-supported lobbying or because of lobbying supported by public. O'Reilly's move creates more awareness for the issue and their opposition is more credible given that, assuming simplistic logic, they, as a publisher, only stand to loose money because of shorter copyright. But it's a very strong way to point out, that:
<ul>
<li> after 14 years they're probably not making any money anyway
<li> the benefit to the public of returning books to public domain in some reasonable timeframe dramatically outweight the small incremental revenue that publishers might otherwise enjoy; after all copyright was not introduced to benefit publisher (selected few) but the public (everyone else) it's just at some point someone tragically lost track of what is and isn't beneficial to public. Which means you and me.
