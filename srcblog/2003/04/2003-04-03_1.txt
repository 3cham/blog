Title: DEFCON talks on-line

<b>DEFCON talks on-line.</b>

There is <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/links/defcon-media-archives.html">an archive of DEF CON talks</a> available on-line. Too bad they're 
only a streaming RealVideo files so you cannot copy them locally. Is there a way 
to save RealVideo streams to disk?
