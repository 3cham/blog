Title: Solving a problem you didn't have.

<b>Solving a problem you didn't have.</b>

I don't remember where I saw it (except that it was on the Internet), but there was 
this guy deriding Apple for solving problems they didn't have. One example of 
this was when promoting OS X Apple would proudly announce that it has 
pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection. This was certainly an 
improvement over Mac OS but when OS X has been released it could hardly be 
considered a technological breakthrough: at the time the concept has been known 
for ages and for years implemented in Unix or Windows. And of course Apple would 
never admit that not having memory protection in Mac OS was a problem. Hence 
Apple being proud of solving a problem they didn't have. 

<a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=5245">This story</a> is 
another example of solving a problem you don't have. Palm announces that they've 
overcame 16 MB memory limitation in Palm OS. Never mind that Pocket PCs are 
already shipping with 64 MB of RAM and the limitation in Palm is caused by their 
own incompetence in the first place. How they're not ashamed to call it &quot;an 
innovation&quot; is beyond me.
