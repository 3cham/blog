Title: Another hd-based MP3 player.

<b>Another hd-based MP3 player.</b>

From the section: gadgets I want to have. <a href="http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/337/C1643/">
iHP-100</a> is 10 GB MP3 that uses the same hard-drive as iPod. The good thing 
about that is that it's really small. The bad thing is that it's going to be 
expensive at $415. Of course, I'm not holding my breath. I've learned that 
&quot;announced&quot; is spelled &quot;will be available (maybe) in undisclosed future&quot;.
