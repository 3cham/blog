Title: Why ransom won't work (very well).

<b>Why ransom won't work (very well).</b>

So there is <a href="http://users.sisna.com/woodcock/yanoff.htm">this guy</a> 
who thinks that he invented a new model for compensating open-source developers: 
RansomWare. He's updating an existing, GPL-ed NNTP (Usenet) reader for Palm OS 
but he will not release the update (and source to it) until he will get a 
promise from people for a pre-determined (but unknown, as far as I can tell) 
amount of money. Two comments from me:<ul>
  <li>this is not a new idea</li>
  <li>it won't work (very well)</li>
</ul>
<p>The page where he describes his idea seems to be made in late 2002. In 1998 
Bruce Schneier and J. Kelsey published a paper that appeared in USENIX Workshop 
on e-commerce titled <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/street_performer.html">
The Street Performer Protocol</a> (you can read html version at
<a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue4_6/kelsey/">FirstMonday</a>). 
Much more thorough treatment of the subject is available at
<a href="http://www.theoretic.com/Ransom/Home">Theoretic Solutions</a>. And I 
know all that thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Performer_Protocol">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Why it won't work (very well)? There will be exceptions (the one 
(and only) successful case of RansomWare I know of was the process of GPL-ing
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>) but it's an observable fact that 
it's not working because I don't see anyone doing it. The guy is trying but he's 
not doing all that great: after more than 5 months he has a pledge for about 
$170. You can earn that much in less than week in a full-time position for a 
minimum wage. After we answered the question &quot;does it work&quot;, the interesting 
question is: &quot;why it doesn't work&quot;? In theory, from user/customer perspective, 
it's much cheaper way of getting software: in commercial model every costumer 
has to pay for a copy of the program, in the RansomWare model all costumers need 
to come up with a fixed amount so it's very likely that a per-copy price will be 
much smaller. But in practice there are many reasons this model breaks (in 
comparison to commercial model).
<p>
One problem is that it's just not how we've been doing things in 
the past and habit is a very strong force. People are used to paying for stuff 
that they know exists. We're not used to paying for some future benefit whose 
nature isn't entirely known. Even if the program is well defined (as an Usenet 
reader is) so that people know more or less what to expect, a list of promised 
features cannot compete with a copy of the program to test or a review by 
existing, happy user. The model breaks completely with innovative software: when 
people don't even know what to expect, they won't pay and no amount of marketing 
material will convince them otherwise.
<p>The number of money one can get is proportional to the number of 
users of the program. Even if we assume that the quality is the same, it should 
not be a surprise that this number is much higher for software developed using 
commercial model. The way things work in the software business is that, except 
for a few runaway successes like Netscape or WinAMP or ICQ (but they prove the 
point even more), you have to build your user base slowly. Joel says:
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html">good 
software takes 10 years - get used to it</a> and that's very true. By 
definition, software that doesn't yet exist cannot build a user base.
<p>Oh, and the name.
