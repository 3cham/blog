Title: Another open-source vs. closed-source debate.

<b>Another open-source vs. closed-source debate.</b>

<a href="http://armedndangerous.blogspot.com/2002_07_28_armedndangerous_archive.html">This 
article</a> by E. Raymond is rather old but I just found it today. Eric claims 
that growing complexity of software projects (which is a fact) will favor 
open-source because closed-source method of development doesn't scale and, to 
quote, &quot;only development organizations that seem to 
thrive on today's complexity regime are open-source teams&quot;. Too bad this 
statement doesn't have a basis in reality. It is a fact that so far 
closed-source projects are bigger and more complex that open-source projects. 
Windows is bigger than Linux, Microsoft Office is bigger than Open Office (and 
much better), Oracle is bigger than MySQL or PostgreSQL and so on. While one 
will probably find an exception (I would guess that Mozilla is bigger than IE or 
Apache+all available modules is bigger than IIS) but still number of open-source 
projects that are really big is very small and you will undoubtedly find plenty 
of closed-source projects that are much bigger than the biggest open-source 
projects.

The assertion that open-source scales better that closed-source process has not supporting evindence whatsoever.
