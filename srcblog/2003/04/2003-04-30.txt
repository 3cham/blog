Title: Pepper is back.

<b>Pepper is back.</b> In an interesting twist, <a href="http://www.hekkelman.com/index.html">Pepper</a> 
  (a text editor) is back. The story with Pepper was that its author apparently 
  got angry at Linux customers being impolite to him and at the same time not 
  buying the program (or some such; this is just a guess based on publicly available 
  information) and decided to stop development, there were some talks about open-sourcing 
  it but it required $10 k to be paid which was too much to get in donations so 
  Pepper was sold to <a href="http://www.digitalwandering.com/">someone 
  else</a> but apparently not really because now it's back and done by the 
  original developer. Or to be more precise: the original developer decided to 
  continue Windows and Unix version (strangely enough given that it was supposedly 
  Unix people that made him stop developing in the first place) and someone else 
  will develop Mac version.
<p> Anyway, regardless of how much I like Pepper I have to say that there's not 
  much money in the "text editor" business those days. There's too much of a good 
  stuff available for free.
