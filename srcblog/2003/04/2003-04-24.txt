Title: Symbian has already beat the pants off Microsoft.

<b>Symbian has already beat the pants off Microsoft.</b>

The love is 
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030422.html#151618">clearly blind</a>. Just listen to 
this: Symbian has already beaten Microsoft in the mobile area. I wonder if 
Microsoft (or Palm) did notice that. So far the facts are that Palm has (still) 
a majority of market share for PDA devices. Microsoft's Pocket PC is steadily 
gaining market share. Then there is a distant third place which might belong to 
Symbian but that's just a blip. And Symbian (and its partners) aren't doing a 
great job promoting it. First, free tools for C/C++ development for OS 7 still 
aren't available (and yes, you can get free tools for both Palm and Pocket PC). 
They only shipped two or three products (phones) which aren't all that superior 
to Palm's or Microsoft's offerings (in some cases they are better, in some cases 
they're worse). Then the developer programs are fragmented: Nokia, Motorola and 
SonyEricsson all have their own separate little developer programs instead of 
Symbian having one that offers all the good stuff in one place. Not to mention 
the fixation they all seem to have on multimedia (i.e. cameras integrated with 
the phone).
