Title: Is PhotoWorks any good?

<b>Is PhotoWorks any good?</b> On my list of things to try is printing some digital photos using <a href="http://www.photoworks.com/">PhotoWorks</a>. I've started taking a lot of pictures with my digital camera and I would like to have some of them in more real form but I haven't tried any printing services yet and have no idea how good they are. Why starting with PhotoWorks? Because it was mentioned on <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/16.html#a3358">The Scobleizer Weblog</a>.
