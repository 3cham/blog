Title: Good software, bad buying experience.

<b>Good software, bad buying experience. </b>

Now that I told you that 
<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/000437.html#000437">Frigate is the best file manager</a> I know, I'll tell you that 
<a href="http://www.frigate3.com/">Frigate</a> - the company sucks. 
My 30-day trial period just ended so I went on-line and bought &quot;Frigate 
Professional&quot; ($59.90 but if you know the right URL you can get it for $39.94) 
via RegSoft. That was 3 days ago and I still don't have the registration info 
and as a result can't use the software. When I ordered I received a confirmation 
e-mail with a link to a web page with my order status. That's all good except 
that the status still is &quot;unprocessed&quot;. I don't know if it's RegSoft that sucks 
or is it Frigate so uninterested in my money but I'm pissed, I don't care and 
I'll never buy from them again (and would cancel my order if I could).<p>The 
thing is: the Internet creates an expectation of instant gratification. I pay 
and I expect to have the goods within minutes given that what I'm buying is a 
link where I can download a few megabytes of code or an unlock code for the 
software that I already have. I expect that because it's possible and everyone 
else gives me that. The guys selling Frigate violated this expectation. The 
result: no more money from me and this post where I tell everyone that they 
suck.</p>
<p>Lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when you sell software, provide instant gratification</li>
  <li>when you sell software, avoiding pissing&nbsp; people off is even more 
  important than delighting them (you should do both, of course)</li>
</ul>
