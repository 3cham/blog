Title: iEdit - another collaborative editor.
Draft: 1

<a href="http://www.silvernetwork.net/~quiksw/othersoftware/iedit.html">iEdit</a> is a multi-platform (Mac OS X, Mac OS 9/Windows) <a href="http://hydra.globalse.org/">Hydra</a> clone (Hydra is Mac-only).

I tried it but I couldn't do anything without connecting somewhere and didn't know where to connect.
