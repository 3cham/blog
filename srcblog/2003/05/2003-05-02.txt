Title: Zoning laws and home-based software company.

There was <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61701&cid=0&pid=0&startat=&threshold=3&mode=flat&commentsort=0&op=Change">
an interesting discussion</a> that started with a question about how zoning laws relate to a software company
ran from home. Some of advice given:
<ul>
<li> just ignore zoning laws; nobody cares
<li> do not ignore zoning laws; you're screwed when they get you
<li> think a lot about business side of the business, not only about technical side
<li> get health insurance
<li> join <a href="http://www.nase.org">National Association for the Self-Employed</a>. Among other benefits
they have one of the best independent health insurance plans.
</ul>
