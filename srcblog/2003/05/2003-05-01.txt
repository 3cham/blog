Title: Few ideas for RSS aggregators.

<b>Few ideas for RSS aggregators.</b> I was a late convert to RSS aggregation 
but now that I know how much more news I can read now (compared to my previous 
method of web browsing) I'm not going back. I use Syndirella which is good but 
basic so I have a few ideas for improvements.
<p>People who read this blog also like... We live in a networked world. Aggregators 
  have access to great information: lists of RSS feeds that people subscribe to. 
  It would be fairly easy to implement the Amazon-style recommendation system: 
  for each RSS feed aggregator could mine other people's lists to find blogs that 
  those people also like to read.</p>
<p>One-panel view. Most aggregators use three panels: list of feeds, list of entries 
  in a feed, feed itself. My regular usage of an aggregator is: launch, get all 
  updates, read through them all. </p>
<p>Automatically calculate the update interval. Syndirella by defaults checks 
  the feeds for updates every 1 hour and enables you to change that. Why not remember 
  when the feed has been updated and automatically re-adjust the update interval?</p>
<p>Some feeds are better than others. I like some feeds so much that I want to 
  read them as soon as they show up. Other feeds I would like to read only when 
  I'm extremely bored. Syndirella doesn't allow me to make this distinction. I 
  should be able to mark feeds as important or not and in default reading mode 
  the non-important ones would be cached locally (so I don't loose the updates) 
  but filtered out. Then I should be able to switch to &quot;reading everything&quot; 
  mode where I also see the unimportant feeds.
<p>Some entries are more interesting than others. Most of the stuff I read is 
  of the &quot;read and forget&quot; kind but sometimes it contains information 
  interesting enough that I would like to save it for the future. I could do it 
  manually by copying the text somewhere but I'm too lazy. I would like to have 
  an easy way (one mouse-click or one key-press) to mark an entry as important 
  (and then an easy way to locate those entries).
