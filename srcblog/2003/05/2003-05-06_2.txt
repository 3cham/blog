Title: SD memory overtakes Memory Stick

InfoSync World <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3530.html">reports 
that SD memory overtakes Memory Stick</a>. What actually surprised me in those 
news is that Memory Stick was ever more popular. Sony is pushing Memory Stick 
standard as hard as they can but I fail to see why they think they can compete 
with a standard used by companies too numerous to mention. Earth to Sony: we've 
got two things for you to ponder about: 
<ul>
<li>economy of scale </li>
<li> open standards</li>
</ul>
