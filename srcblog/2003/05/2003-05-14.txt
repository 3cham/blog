Title: Integrating blogs and wikis.

<b>Integrating blogs and wikis.</b> Executive summary: blogs and wikis should 
be integrated. For the first blogging engine that adds wiki-like capabilities 
it will be a marketable advantage. 
<p> Currently wikis and blogs are separate worlds: some people are bloggers, some 
  people are wiki users. Conceptually they are variations on the same theme: web-based 
  content management and content publishing. They usually serve different goals: 
  blogs are chronological, private soap-boaxes. I write my blog entries and I 
  don't want anyone to change them (although I might allow people to comment on 
  them). Blogs are mostly for stating my opinions or useful tidbits of information. 
  Wikis are usually public and geared toward collaboration with other people (although 
  nothing prevents making them more of a private space). Technologically they 
  are very similar: both wikis and blogs are bags of posts. They mostly differ 
  in how those posts are presented.
<p>Given this similarity the question is: why we don't have more people that have 
  blogs and wikis integrated into one system? Is it because there is no need for 
  that? It would be hard to decide that. If we judge it only by current popularity 
  of blog/wiki combos then the answer would be no. But if we judged the demand 
  for blogs 5 years ago we would also say that there is no demand. It took persistence 
  of few dedicated evangelists for them to become mainstream thing they are now. 
  I think many people are both bloggers and wiki users, they just use their own 
  blogs and thematic (i.e. not personal) wikis. So the question boils down to: 
  are personal wikis useful for many people. For the sake of the argument, I'll 
  say that they are. But we won't know until it's as easy to have blog/wiki combo 
  as it is to have just a blog. Which is to say &quot;until Movable Type/Radio/Blogger 
  add wikis&quot;. I have a wiki on my site but setting that was not easy and 
  required a lot from my hosting account (ability to run PHP and access to a MySQL 
  database). 
<p>What could be the benefit of having integrated blog/wiki? For one, why not 
  have the ability to create weblog entries using wiki syntax? Search should also 
  look at both.
<p>I think that the main reason we don't have such tool yet is that programmers 
  that write blogging tools are not the programmers that write wikis. (Ok, there's 
  at least one tool, <a href="http://tikiwiki.sourceforge.net">TikiWiki</a>, that 
  has both wikis and blogs (and much more) but it's not very popular).
