Title: Color SideKick by end of next month.

<b>Color SideKick by end of next month.</b> According to <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1041_3-999737.html?tag=fd_top">this CNET article</a> Danger will release a new, color SideKick by the end of the month.  It will be sold by T-Mobile (just as the current one). It will also have a faster processsor (48MHz - which is still slow compared to other current PDAs that reach 400 MHz), more memory (32 MB vs. 16 MB currently) and a better camera (320x240). It's great news but it has to be said that Danger's party line is a bit suspicious. In short they claimed that they don't intend to make any money on the device itself but only on the services. Lower price for the device would make it more affordable for costumer so they could buy more of them so Danger would make more money on services. The reality is that new color SideKick, at projected $300, isn't more expensive and underpowered compared to Palm and Pocket PC devices that you can buy for around $300. Maybe that's just the economy of scale kicking in for Palm/Pocket PC but even new SideKick will keep me waiting for something faster, with more memory, bigger screen with higher resolution, bluetooth and some external memory slot (SD/MMC or CompactFlash).
