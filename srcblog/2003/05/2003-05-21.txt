Title: Making first steps with Chandler.

<b>Making first steps with Chandler.</b> I checked out CVS sources for <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Chandler</a> 
- the PIM/e-mail client to rule them all. Some day. Chandler has teething problems. 
My attempts to build it on Windows failed because of bugs in the build system 
(bug <a href="http://bugzilla.osafoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=575">575</a>, 
<a href="http://bugzilla.osafoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=576">576</a>, <a href="http://bugzilla.osafoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580">580</a>). 
Fortunately bugs were quickly fixed which is good. Unfortunately Chandler crashes 
on startup (bug <a href="http://bugzilla.osafoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=582">582</a>). 
Probably something simple but I didn't have the time to investigate more closely. 
But that's ok, really. Chandler is clearly at a &quot;beware, developer only&quot; 
stage. It's a very ambitious undertaking and I'll watch it closely.
