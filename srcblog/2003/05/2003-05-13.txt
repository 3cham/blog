Title: Another revision control system (i.e. CVS competition)

<b>Another revision control system (i.e. CVS competition).</b> <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">Darcs</a> 
(David's Advanced Revision Control System) is yet another replacement for CVS. 
Written in Haskell and runs on GNU/Linux and MacOS X. Those are the bad parts 
(Haskell limits acceptance and ability of other people to contribute, not running 
on Windows also limits acceptance). </a>&nbsp;The good part is that the author 
seems committed to the project and things quickly move forward (unlike arc which 
gets a lot of mailing list activity and little new code). Lessons learned: according 
to the author merging is very hard.
