Title: What kind of an employee a small software company needs?

<b>What kind of an employee a small software company needs?</b> According to <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">Erick 
Sink</a>, small software company needs flexible developers who do more than just 
writing code. So very true, go read <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html">the 
full article</a> for details. 
<p> On unrelated subject: someone asked about the best way to have one's company

<p> On another unrelated subject: <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=42007&ixReplies=17">this 
  thread</a> dispels the myths of Microsoft's interviewing system. I have a different 
  (but non-competing) theory that can be applied as an anti-argument to a large 
  class of statements of nature &quot;Microsoft's X is crap&quot; e.g. &quot;Microsoft's 
  software is crap&quot;, &quot;Microsoft's hiring practices are crap&quot; etc. 
  The basis of this theory is that software business is competitive and people 
  are not stupid and, in the long term, cannot be consistently tricked into doing 
  something that is clearly not in their interest. Like buying crappy software. 
  If people buy a given piece of software over long-term, then it cannot be crap 
  (defined as &quot;significantly inferior to alternatives&quot;). Usually to 
  defend the &quot;Microsoft's X is crap&quot; position despite staggering market 
  success of X people use &quot;some other Microsoft's Y compensates for X's crappiness&quot; 
  where Y usually is &quot;monopoly&quot; or &quot;marketing&quot;. In other words 
  Microsoft's marketing is so brilliant that they can sell ice to Eskimos at 99% 
  profit margin. Their monopoly gives them basically blank check for selling 20-line 
  VB apps that do nothing for thousands of dollars. But as I said, my basic belief 
  is that software industry is competitive. That, among other things, means that 
  it's impossible to have one, single advantage that will compensate over terrible 
  mistakes like creating clearly inferior products. Even in established categories 
  (like Office) there is competition waiting for Microsoft to slip. It might just 
  be that their marketing is exceptionally good and can compensate for a slightly 
  worse product but it cannot ever be so good to compensate for clearly worse 
  product. 
<p>The same applies to hiring: software companies live or die by programmers. 
  Without good programmers there is no good code, without good code there is no 
  good money. So the best way to measure how good the hiring process is by judging 
  how much money those hires generate and Microsoft is absolutely at the top of 
  the hill by a large margin. So if every other aspect was the same as in other 
  companies, their hiring practice would also be the best by a large margin. Even 
  if we factor in the assumption that there are other things that contribute to 
  Microsoft's success, they could never compensate for a crappy hiring process 
  so in the worst case the hiring process must be between average and good.
