Title: iPod and Windows - problems, solutions.

<b>iPod and Windows - problems, solutions.</b> My 10 GB <a href="http://www4.tomshardware.com/mobile/20021003/">iPod</a> 
arrived today. Hardware is delightful but I'm using Windows so there were problems. 
Here are a few things I learned: 
<ul>
  <li>iPod doesn't come with USB cable by default (thank god my laptop has FireWire 
    interface); you have to buy FireWire-to-USB converter cable yourself if you 
    don't have FireWire interface in your PC</li>
  <li>when you plug iPod to PC it is also visible as an external hard-drive (and 
    if you use Windows XP you don't even need to install any drivers) but by default 
    iPod's hard-drive was formatted using Mac-compatible HPFS file system. Do 
    not re-format it yourself to be FAT32, as I did, since it kills iPod</li>
  <li>when you kill iPod you can always reset it to factory state which I managed 
    to do it after using <a href="http://www.the-midfield.com/ipod.aspx">every</a> 
    <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120119">possible</a> 
    iPod updater I could find on the net. I did the reset multiple times but following 
    the instructions didn't work: after update iPod just didn't want to go back 
    to life and was stuck displaying &quot;OK to disconnect&quot; (long after 
    I've disconnected). Finally I did the reset on iPod and it started working.</li>
  <li>it's distressing that I was asked, twice, to enter my personal data (once 
    for Apple once for MusicMatch) just to be able to install software that I 
    didn't even want. Not to mention being forced to enter multi-digit numbers 
    (iPod's serial number and MusicMatch's serial number). It's distressing given 
    that I've already gave them my money and they still treat me like a thief, 
    show absolute disrespect for my time and my privacy in the hope of squeezing 
    some incremental revenue from me by means of bombarding me with spam (how 
    else?)</li>
  <li>in astonishing display of incompetency, software included on CD (iPod manager 
    (whatever that is), iPod Updater (the thing that allows to reset iPod to factory 
    settings/update firmware and MusicMatch Jukebox) failed to install correctly. 
    After forcing me to reset every attempt to launch any of the included apps 
    triggered installation dialog that kept asking me to point it to &quot;iPod 
    for Windows.msi&quot; but refusing to accept it when I did. So I just uninstalled 
    suckers.</li>
  <li>although you do see iPod as a hard-drive, you can't just copy music to it 
    and have it seen by iPod automatically (another example of removing useful 
    functionality based on assumption that we're all thieves) so you have to have 
    a special app that knows the secret handshake. On a Mac it's iTunes, on Windows 
    it's MusicMatch Jukebox (if you manage to install it). But I use <a href="http://www.ephpod.com/">ephHod</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ephpod.com/">ephPod</a> rocks and is free (it's a tool 
    that allows transferring music from a PC to iPod). BTW: transferring using 
    FireWire is damn fast</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ipodlounge.com/">iPod Lounge</a> is a place to visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I mention that iPod is really cool? It's amazingly small, it's super-stylish, 
  it works well and 10 GB is more than I'll ever need.
