Title: Hooked on wiki.

I knew about wikis for quite some time but the only way to really appreciate things is to experience them. So I installed my own Wiki. The idea is that I'll use it as a system for storing my knowledge and ideas about stuff. How it'll turn out in the practice - I don't really know.
