Title: Convergence is the future

<b>Convergence is the future.</b>

I just read <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/consumer/20030124/index.html">
this review</a> of DP-450, a DVD player that can also play DivX videos, show 
pictures stored on a CD-ROM and play MP3 files. Two things came into my mind 
when I finished.<p><b>Bad marketing.</b> I wanted to find out more about this 
device (especially how much does it cost) but neither of
<a href="http://www.kiss-technology.com/">two</a>
<a href="http://www.kissdvd.com/">sites</a> is well designed nor provides a lot 
of useful information nor tells where one can buy this thing (probably because 
you just can't). Aren't those guys just wasting their buzz by having reviews 
show up when the device itself cannot be bought?</p>
<p><b>Convergence is the future.</b> In retrospect the idea of extending 
capabilities of home entertainment devices is brilliantly obvious. There really 
is no reason for having a separate MP3 player and separate DVD player. What we 
should (and hopefully will) end up is Tivo that also has DVD drive, can play 
DVDs, MP3, DiVX, can stream the music wirelessly etc. All in one. One device to 
rule them all.
