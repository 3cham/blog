Title: Pretty but pathetic.

<b>Pretty but pathetic.</b>

I have to say that it's pretty pathetic that I have to use Front Page to write 
updates to my weblog. It just shows how immature this field still is. Note: I 
have nothing against Front Page but I should be able to update my blog from 
within a tool that supports this blog natively and gives my a desktop-like 
experience (ability to compose blog entries off-line, WYSIWYG editing, 
spell-checking - I'm not asking for much). All the free tools were awful (of the 
beginner's-twenty-minutes-programming-exercise variety). Out of commercial tools 
I've tried <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio</a>, in principle, does 
that, but it crashed on me one too many times and its interface is bizarre (just 
a nice way to say that it sucks). <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/">
CityDesk</a> looks like it would fit the bill but they only support publishing 
in HTML and I wanted something server-based (now I question that decision but 
it's been made and I'm not switching again).<p>

So I'm stuck with preparing entries as a HTML fragment and using web-based 
front-end of MT to merely publish the content. There's something's wrong with 
that picture.
