Title: My crystal ball

<b>My crystal ball.</b>

My crystal ball tells me that in 2003 someone will create a 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>-inspired (by which I mean also 
based on
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/kdeqt/kde3arch/khtml/">
KHTML</a> and having similar to Safari look and feel) browser for Windows. The 
idea is obvious to conceive, easy to implement and hard to resist. Someone will 
do it. On a more wishful note: would be good if someone added KHTML-based HTML 
component to <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a>. The one they have 
is primitive and IE wrapper is Windows-only.
