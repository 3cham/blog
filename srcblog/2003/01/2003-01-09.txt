Title: Lying with a straight face.

<b>Lying with a straight face.</b>
In my naive moments I think there's a limit to how outragously you can lie. MPEG LA consortium just set me straight by proving that, in fact, there's not limit. In a shocking spin they <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-980007.html?tag=lh">accuse Microsoft</a> of anti-competitive practices because it charges smaller licensing fees for their codecs that MPEG LA for their so called "open-standard" MPEG 4. Now, what definition of "open-standard" is MPEG LA using beats me totally. It'll be open when it has zero licensing fees. Accidently that'll also make it very resistant to competition from Microsoft (or any competitive encoder, for that matter).
