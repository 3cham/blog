Title: Addicted to trailers.

<b>Addicted to trailers.</b>

I'm  addicted to trailers on <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">Apple's</a> site.
Have. To. Check. Them. Every. Day. Recent additions worth mentioning:
<ul>
<li> Tarantino's new movie <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/kill_bill/">Kill Bill</a>. Yes, 
it's THE Tarantino, a man who made waves and then went to sleep. My first 
impression: Tarantino-does-Matrix. There's going to be
<a href="http://www.vugames.com/vug/product.do?gamePlatformId=232">a game</a> 
too.<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/howtoloseaguyin10days/">How 
to loose a guy in ten days</a> - so I like romantic comedies. Sue me.<li>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/bruce_almighty.html">Bruce 
Almighty</a> - Jim Carrey is back as Jim-Carrey-kind-of-a-character<li>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/columbia/badboys2/">Bad Boys 2</a> - the 
only thing I liked about the first part was Tea Leoni but she's not in this one; 
will watch anyway<li>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/old_school.html">Old School</a> 
- since I found out that Will Farell is a genius I immediately started to like 
him (although I probably wouldn't figure it out on my own)<li>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/columbia/tearsofthesun/">Tears of the sun</a> 
- the plot can be fully deducted from the trailer and is ridiculous: a 
very-special-force unit is sent to Nigeria to evacuate U.S. doctor-babe. The 
problem: U.S. doctor-babe has a staff of natives that will be killed if not 
evacuated. VSFu (very-special-force unit) is not supposed to evacuate them. 
Bruce struggles with himself and decides to rescue them anyway, breaking direct 
orders and risking the lives of his men. That's one lousy soldier, if you ask 
me. But to miss a chance to see Bruce Willis running around with guns wearing 
his fierce-will-do-the-right-thing face? Never.
