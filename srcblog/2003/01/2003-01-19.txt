Title: Author lacks originality - news at eleven

Recently I <a href="../../../2003/01/16/idea-for-a-newshound.html">described</a> an idea for a service/program that monitors the news for things of interest. 

It looks like somebody <a href="http://www.newsbooster.com/">has already done that</a> (and they charge 199 euros/month for the service).
