Title: Idea for a newshound.

<b>Idea for newshound.</b>

There is a problem with the way we look for information on the Internet. Suppose 
that you're interested in all the news about Danger's HipTop device. It's being 
mentioned once every couple of days here and there, sometimes less frequently. 
Currently the best way would be to go to <a href="http://news.google.com">
news.google.com</a> every now and then, launch the query, read all the new 
articles that appeared since the last time you searched (if any). Another 
problem is that you might get false positives e.g. if you look for &quot;sidekick&quot; 
(another name for HipTop) you'll get plenty of mostly bogus hits. But imagine 
that there is an omniscient entity that new about all the new stories published 
on the Internet, knew what things you're interested in and would send you links 
to all new stories about things that interest you. Enter NewsHound (or Personal 
News Filter) TM. Google knows about new articles on the Internet. We could write 
a program that automates the tedious: querying Google News every once in a 
while, removing duplicate postings, deciding if the article really is on the 
subject, notify you about new stuff. It could either be a desktop app, sitting 
quietly in the background or a web-based app that would notify you about new 
stuff on a regular basis via. e-mail. To better decide if a given hit is really 
on the subject as opposed to just containing the word you're looking for,
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">statistical filtering</a> could be 
used. It's an extremely simple app: a text box for entering new query terms, 
ability to remove/modify/disable query terms, nice display of results, gui for 
statistical filter (a button with &quot;on subject&quot; for hits currently classified as 
not on subject and &quot;not on subject&quot; for hits currently classified as on 
subject). Some HTML scrapping. Maybe cache all the hits so that you don't loose 
them when they disappear from the web. Maybe ability to mark some as 
&quot;interesting&quot;, for future reference (although it would be more useful in a 
broader context of an app used for information gathering). Maybe publish 
people's query terms on the web, just for kicks? Web version could provide a 
web-service like functionality i.e. generate the results so that people can 
include them in their own web pages (even static HTML pages using JavaScript 
tricks). Maybe it should just generate RSS feed? So, do you have an evening to 
spare? (a few hours later: damn, idea's nothing new. It's one of the &quot;program 
ideas&quot; on Google's API <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">site</a> 
(&quot;auto-monitor web for new information on a subject&quot;). Gotta try harder).
