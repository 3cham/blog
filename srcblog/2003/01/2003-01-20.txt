Title: Source Insight 3.5

A new version of Source Insight (3.5) 
<a href="http://www.sourceinsight.com">has been 
released</a>. Source Insight is a programmer's editor. If you code on a big 
C/C++, C# or Java projects - go check it out. I can't live without it. If only they had support for Python.
