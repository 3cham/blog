Title: Browsing Newton

<b>Browsing Newton.</b>

I was browsing various <a href="http://www.splorp.com/links/newton/">Newton 
sites</a> and it's funny to see that (judging by screenshots) Newton, despite 
being long dead, was much powerful and better design OS than Palm OS and Pocket 
PC are today.
