Title: Automated Alexa

<b>Automated Alexa.</b> There is this web service called
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> that allows you to see popularity of 
your web site. It would be nice to be able to monitor changes in popularity of a 
web site. Alexa itself doesn't provide that information but a third-party app 
could. It would query Alexa from time to time to get the current rank and e-mail 
the user changes (I assume the rank doesn't change a lot so low-frequency 
communication (e.g. every week) makes sense here). This is one example of a 
meta-idea: notification services. Of course the idea of notifications services 
isn't new but we don't seem to have a lot of them. But we will because it's the 
next logical step. The pull model is more efficient (technologically) and saves 
time (for humans). It has happened in the past when interrupts replaced polling 
in computer hardware, it'll happen for the web.<a href="http://www.googlert.com/"> 
Googlert</a> is an example and more will come.
