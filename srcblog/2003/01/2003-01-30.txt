Title: Kapor talks about Chandler

<b>Kapor talks about Chandler.</b>

Today Mitch Kapor <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/">will talk</a> about <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org">Chandler</a>. This is interesting for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>Chandler project is interesting
<li> the talk will (hopefully) be available on-line as video web-cast
</ul>
In the past I watched quite a few talks from that series and they were great. Can't wait to see this one.
