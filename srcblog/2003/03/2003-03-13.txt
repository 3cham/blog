Title: Vaio Z1 - notebook lust.

<b>Notebook lust.</b>

It's been a long time since I salivated about a notebook - my Dell Latitude C610 
works just fine for me. But I wouldn't mind upgrading to

Sony VAIO Z1</a>. It's not a giant leap forward but a nice refinement of the 
concept. Z1 improves on C610 in the following:
<ul>
<li>looks better
<li>weights less (that's important for me)
<li>integrated wireless
<li>USB 2.0 and FireWire ports
<li>can take bigger hard-drives (up to 60 GB)
<li>battery lasts longer
</ul>
without sacrificing features that I came to depend upon: 14'' screen with 1400x1050 resolution.
