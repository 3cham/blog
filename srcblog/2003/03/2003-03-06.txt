Title: Palm OS dev newsgroups

<b>Palm OS dev newsgroups.</b> There are two that I know of:<ul>
  <li>groups hosted at <a href="news://news.falch.net">news://news.falch.net</a></li>
  <li>groups hosted at <a href="news://news.palmos.com">news://news.palmos.com</a> 
  (but you have to first subscribe to each group
  <a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/forums/sub.html">here</a> before 
  you can read/post; annoying)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course my search for a good newsgroup reader continues. Just tried Windows 
version of <a href="http://pan.rebelbase.com/">Pan</a> but it likes to crash (I 
could live with that) and pretended that it forgotten all my newsgroups settings (that 
was scary)
