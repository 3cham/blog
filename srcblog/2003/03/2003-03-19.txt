Title: Danger launches SDK

<b>Danger launches SDK.</b>

Well, almost does. API documentation is available at 
<a href="http://developer.danger.com/">developer.danger.com</a>
Of course I've signed up to their developer program right after
<a href="http://boingboing.net/#200007878">reading the news</a>. Emulator and 
tools are supposed to be released later. There are
<a href="http://www.hiptop.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3735&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=150">
some unhappy voices</a>. We'll have to wait and see how the situation will 
develop however Danger doesn't score the best marks yet. The notion of developer 
&quot;levels&quot; is worrying and the way of running developer forums via &quot;virtual 
currency&quot; is downright stupid. Both Palm and Microsoft just post their tools on 
the web site, point to Usenet developer groups and that's all the involvement 
that is really needed.
