Title: A little bit of lying.

In my post 
about Symbian development tools I lied a bit (ignorance, not malice).

<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0102385/2003/03/08.html#a300">sets me straight</a>. 
<p>
In my post I lumped together Symbian OS 6 (Nokia 3650) and Symbian OS 7 
(SonyEricsson P800) and I wrote that you cannot develop only using free tools. 
That's not true: freely available SDKs for both versions of Symbian OS have 
free, GCC-based tools that can create executables you can run directly on the 
phone itself. </p>

<p>You only need commercial tools (Visual C++ 6 for OS 6 and 
Metrowerks CodeWarrior for OS 7) if you want to be able to use 
emulator/debugger. 
</p>

<p>The catch here is that it's extremely hard to develop serious 
applications without emulator and good debugging support. At best it's going to 
take much more time and at worst it's going to be impossible. So one is kind of 
forced to buy those tools and I'll stick to my conclusion that 
Symbian/Nokia/Ericsson aren't doing nearly enough to support developers (and in 
turn their market share). </p>

<p>That being said CodeWarrior Personal Edition (which 
should be good enough for efficient development) isn't that expensive ($399). </P>
