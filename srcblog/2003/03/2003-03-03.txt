Title: Remote desktop - from Windows to Mac OS X

<b>Remote desktop - from Windows to Mac OS X.</b>

I just tested VNC-ing from my Windows XP box to my Mac OS X. VNC is an 
open-source (GPL-ed) multi-platform remote display application.&nbsp; VNC looks 
like the most frequently forked application. There are:<ul>
  <li>the original VNC from <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">
  AT&amp;T/University of Cambridge</a>, no longer developed (I think) since AT&amp;T 
  shut down the research center</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">realVNC</a>, maintained by original 
  authors of VNC</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/">tightVNC</a>, which focuses on 
  improving compression (which improves overall quality of the software)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tridiavnc.com/">tridiaVNC</a>, Just Another Version 
  with commercial PRO version (wonder how can they do it without breaking GPL), 
  doesn't seem to be maintained anymore</li>
  <li><a href="http://ultravnc.sourceforge.net/">UltraVNC</a>, which focuses on 
  Windows goodies</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.redstonesoftware.com/osxvnc/">OSXvnc</a> is a server 
  for Mac OS X</li>
  <li><a href="http://ultravnc.sourceforge.net/links.html">even more links</a> 
  for VNC-inspired software</li>
</ul>
<p>I used OSXvnc as the server and tried realVNC, UltraVNC and tightVNC as 
clients on Windows XP. I'll stick with tightVNC as it seems to be most 
responsive (I'm using it with <code>-compresslevel 9 -quality 9</code> command line 
settings). So the question: <b>does it work?</b> Barely. The quality mostly 
depends on the speed of your network connection. I was VNCing over my home 
wireless network (UltraVNC reported the speed of around 2400 kbit/s) and the UI 
redraws so slowly that working is no pleasure at all. It works but is no fun. It 
has to be said that Microsoft did much better job with their remote desktop 
software.
