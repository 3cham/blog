Title: How to compile Plucker on cygwin

<a href="http://www.plkr.org">Plucker</a> is, among other things, a document viewer for Palm OS. Since the binary version you can download from their website doesn't work on my Palm Tungsten T I tried to compile the newest version from CVS, the programming stud I am. Of course it took me days rather than hours and the head-ache isn't gone yet. I'll summarize things I had to do.

Note: I only built Palm OS viewer.

First you have to have cygwin with Palm OS dev tools i.e. <a href="http://prc-tools.sf.net">prc-tools</a>, I used latest 2.2 version) installed but I'm not going to cover that topic. 

The first obstacle was that I didn't have many tools that are required to compile
sources (automake/autoconf/pkg-config and probably others) so I had to install them.

Second problem was that plucker doesn't compile if developement version of automake/autoconf is used (see <a href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2001/msg00177.html">this</a> for more info about this particular mess). Solution: add <code>AC_PREREQ(2.13)</code> line to <tt>configure.in</tt> in <tt>viewer</tt> directory. This trick forces using stable version of automake/autoconf.

Third problem was that compiler was that the include path of gcc was messed up and when Palm OS headers were including <tt>&lt;Font.h&gt;</tt> header file, gcc would pick up <tt>Font.h</tt> file from Plucker sources. Solution: change <tt>CFLAGS</tt> definition in <tt>Makefile.in</tt> to:

<pre>CFLAGS = -Werror -Wall -O2 -isystem . -I$(srcdir)/$(ZLIBDIR) @CFLAGS@ $(SDK_CFLAGS)
</pre>

It's a hack, but it worked.

Fourth problem I had was that I installed pilrc version that came with Metrowerks IDE and it didn't work, so I re-compiled pilrc 2.9p5 from sources (available <a href="http://www.ardiri.com/index.php?redir=palm&cat=pilrc&subcat=patches">here</a>).

And that was the end of my journey. All I had to do was:
<pre>>plucker$ cd viewer
>viewer$ autoreconf
>viewer$ ./configure --with-lang=en
>viewer$ make
</pre>

I'm left with <tt>viewer_en.prc</tt> and a bad taste in my mouth.
