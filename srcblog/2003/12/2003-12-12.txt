Title: Better threaded view in Thunderbird.
Draft: 1

<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/000528.html#000528">I wrote</a> that in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> "there's no way to get a threaded view that combines e-mail that I've sent with the one that I've received". <a href="http://gammatron.novarese.net/">Paul</a> corrected me:
<blockquote>
Actually, there is.  Go to tools -> account settings -> copies &amp; folders, uncheck "place a copy in" and check "BCC these addresses" and put your own address in there.  Then everything you send shows up in your inbox instead of a sent folder, and you can sort the entire inbox by thread, with your messages in with the ones you're replying to.
</blockquote>
So I lied, there is a way to do it. Of course it would be much better if Thunderbird just looked into my "Sent items" folder and did it automatically.
