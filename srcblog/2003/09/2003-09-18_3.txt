Title: Borland to use wxWindows.

<b>Borland to use wxWindows.</b> According <a href="http://wxwindows.org/borland01.htm">to this page</a> Borland is going to use wxWindows in their new C++ product and also help in developing wxWindows. That's another great win for wxWindows (after being adopted by <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Chandler</a>).
