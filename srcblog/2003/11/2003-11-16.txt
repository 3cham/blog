Title: Review of 3 LCD projectors

<b>Review of 3 LCD projectors.</b>
<a href="http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/">Hardware analysis</a> has a <a href="http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1645.1/">review of 3 LCD projectors</a> for home theatre systems: Dell 2100/2200MP, InFocus ScreenPlay 4800 and Sanyo PLV-Z1. A <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=03/11/14/1311210&threshold=1&commentsort=0&mode=nested&cid=7473649">Slashdot poster opines</a> that they also should include Panasonic's projectors (Panasonic  AE-100, Panasonic  AE-300, Panasonic AE-500). 
<p>
Here's a bit of my experience with Dell 3100MP LCD projector. I'm not going to repeat info that you can find in your average review but focus on my personal opinion.
<p>
<b>Why to buy a projector?</b>. Projector works like that thing they have in a movie theatre: you plug video source to it and it projects the image on any fairly smooth and fairly white surface (e.g. a wall or a special projector screen). Projectors have dramatically came down in size and price in recent years (they used to be as big as half the couch and cost in tens of thousands of dollars while now they can be smaller than an X-Box and you can get one for under $1000). Still, they do cost some so why buy one? For me it was an experienced good: I watched a few DVD movies at my friend's who has one of those old, big, expensive projectors and the experience was great. I decided to buy a fairly low-end LCD projector for myself and after some web research ended up buying Dell 3100MP LCD projector for under $2000. I was hoping to watch movies, play X-Box games and use it as a wall-size computer monitor for coding.<p>
<b>Did it work out?</b> I do watch DVD movies and play X-Box games on it and for that purpose it works great. I did try to plug a computer (Apple PowerBook laptop and Dell Laptop) but it didn't work well because text was almost unreadable. Maybe it's possible to get this working better (I've seen much better result from some projector at Fry's) but I didn't try too hard - while the idea is cool projectors typicall max out at 1024x768 which is way less than my LCD screen's 1600x1200 resolution and when working the bigger the resolution the better.<p>
<b>A few practical tips.</b> First be aware that projectors need room. The whole idea and value added of a projector is that the picture is big so you need a big projector screen and projector needs to be far away from the screen (the further away it is the bigger the picture). Also setting it up might involve some manual work (e.g. attaching it to the ceiling).
<p>Darkness is required. Projectors differ in how much light they generate but with Dell 3100MP it has to be very dark in order to watch a movie comfortably. For me the end result is that I can only use it at night because I have very big windows in my room and no way to cover them. Depending on your housing situation it might or might not be a problem; as for me, the "night only" restriction doesn't bother me.
<p>Da noise. Projectors are loud (around 37dB according to specs) but bearable. My projector is located in the worst possible place (right behind my head). To remedy that I just increase the volume. Placing projector as far from people as possible should also help.
<p>Lamp lifetime. A lamp is quite expensive ($500) part of the projector and manual says that a lamp lasts 2000 hr. Someone commented that changing lamps might get expensive in the long run. My take: not a big problem. Even if you use projector 4 hours a day it'll last for 500 days (almost 1.5 years). Realistically, I probably don't use it more than 1 hr a day on average so my lamp should last 2000 days which is enough. Having said that I realize that I mostly use just for watching DVDs. If your usage pattern involves more use (e.g. a lot of gaming, watching TV, using it as a computer monitor) it will get more expensive.
<p>It would be nice to be able to play Divx/mpeg-2 etc. files via the projector but I don't have a player for those (which is not projector's fault - it's just a matter of getting proper player).
