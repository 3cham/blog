Title: Death of Symbian OS?

<b>Death of Symbian OS?</b> <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/article/PalmSource_Talking_with_SonyEriccson">According to Brighthand</a> Sony Ericcson is considering using Palm OS for its future smartphones. While the article doesn't make a big deal out of it, this might mean that the days of Symbian OS are counted. Currently Symbian has two versions of its OS: so called Series 60 and Symbian OS 7 with UIQ user interface library. Series 60 ships in millions of phones but is not a competition to Palm or Pocket PC based smartphones (it's used in very simple phones with smallish screens and 9-key keyboards). Symbian OS 7 is what is used in Sony Ericcson's P800 smartphone which does compete head-to-head with PalmOne's and Microsoft's offerings. P800 shipped in decent quantities (around 1 million) but it faces an uphill battle. Even if it was significantly better than Palm OS or Pocket PC (it isn't) it would have hard time catching up with Palm (and thousands of applications already available for Palm). Platform/OS business has strong networking effects i.e. the more popular it gets, the more likely it is to grow in popularity (just look at Windows). More applications attracts buyers of hardware which attracts more software developers that create even more application etc. So far Symbian OS 7 was relying on the strength of Sony Ericcson to spread itself and results so far aren't that great - the amount of available applications is only a tiny fraction of the richness of Palm or Pocket PC world. Loosing Sony Ericcson to Palm might be the final straw that broke the Symbian's back. Me, I'm still rooting for <a href="http://www.danger.com">Danger's</a> HipTop.
