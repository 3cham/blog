Title: Coding smart.

<b>Coding smart.</b><a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=printer_friendly&pid=69"> Coding smart</a> is a good article on good coding practices. It talks about well known practices like using revision control, doing code reviews, learning from existing code, using google as a research tool, Interesting ideas that were new to me (but make sense, when you think about it), are:
<ul>
<li>keeping developement notes and debugging logs
<li>writing high-level structure of the code (since it's always lost in the details of real code)
<li>write pseudo-code before writing real code
</li></li></li></ul>
