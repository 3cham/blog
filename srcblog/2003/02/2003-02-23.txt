Title: Audioblogs

<b>Audioblogs.</b>

The idea of audioblogs (i.e. putting spoken word instead of written word on the blog) 
is being talked about from time to time. It won't happen on any meaningful scale. 
There are a few problems with it, some of them fixable, some of them not. A 
current but fixable problem is that it's too hard. Acquiring audio recordings 
and posting them to the web is too hard. None of the current weblog tools 
supports audio posting. In time those issues could be fixed (although I don't 
think it's going to happen anytime soon). One of the unfixable problems is that 
for most things written text is actually superior to audio. It's much smaller so 
faster to download. It can be scanned and skipped if not interesting. You can't 
scan audio. Not everyone is a good speaker. What you read here looks exactly the 
same as if it was written by Pulitzer-prize winner journalist. I wouldn't get a 
job as a radio DJ. You can read faster than you can listen to and listening is 
deceptively non-multi-tasking i.e. you might think that you can do something 
else while you're listening but when you do you'll loose it.
