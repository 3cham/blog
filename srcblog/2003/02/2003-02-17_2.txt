Title: Programs that start at boot.

<b>Programs that start at boot.</b>
I'm irritated by all those programs that start at boot but are not in the Startup folder. If you have one of those suckers, you can use regedit and modify HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to remove them.
