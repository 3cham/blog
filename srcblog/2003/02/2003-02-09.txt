Title: Dictionary worth buying.

<b>Dictionary worth buying.</b>

I have this little obsession with languages and dictionaries. I've tried many 
computer dictionaries (i.e. language dictionaries that are computer programs) 
but rarely did I find one that was useful. The content is usually ok (there are 
only a few reputable sources of language dictionaries like Webster or Oxford's 
dictionaries and computer versions are usually based on them) but the execution 
was usually extremely poor. Not to mention the need to use 5 different programs 
if you have 5 different dictionaries. But today I found a fabulous program:
<a href="http://www.ifinger.com/">iFinger</a>. At a second-hand bookstore I 
found three (<a href="http://www.cdaccess.com/html/pc/oxspan.htm">Spanish</a>,
<a href="http://www.cdaccess.com/html/pc/oxgerman.htm">German</a> and
<a href="http://www.cdaccess.com/html/pc/oxfrench.htm">French</a>) bilingual 
(i.e. to and from English) Oxford dictionaries. They all use
<a href="http://www.ifinger.com/">iFinger</a> as their engine which has 2 
advantages:<ul>
  <li>iFinger is well done</li>
  <li>you get all dictionaries in one application</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more dictionaries that can be bought directly from iFinger's 
web-site (but in case of those dictionaries it's cheaper to buy them on a CD - 
go figure).
