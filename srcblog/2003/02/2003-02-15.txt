Title: The power of open-source.

<b>The power of open-source.</b>

Disclaimer: I'm not all that gaga about open-source (as it is overhyped). That being said, <a href="http://btplusplus.sourceforge.net/">this</a> is the power of open-source. Someone didn't like <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">windows BitTorrent client</a> so he wrote his own, improved. Closed, intelectually protected systems don't have this kind of knowledge.
