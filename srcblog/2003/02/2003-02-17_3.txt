Title: Brilliant marketing.

<b>Brilliant marketing.</b>
I never met a Flash animation that I really liked. Until today, that is. Following <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/02/17/0328240.shtml?tid=141&tid=137">this article</a> on Slashdot about Streamium I went to <a href="http://www.streamium.com/">their web page</a>. Click on the big, orange "Play" button. The ad is hilarious. Of course I want wireless for that thing. It should at least have USB port for external WiFi cards. They're fairly cheap those days.
