Title: Photography anecdote.

<b>Photography anecdote.</b>

For all you photography phans, here's a photography anecdote for you:
<blockquote><i>
In one of Galen Rowell's books, he recounts an anecdote about his first photo assignment for National Geographic, to document the first free-climb of El Capitan, in Yosemite National Park. After the several day climb, he turned 70 rolls of exposed film over to National Geographic's photo editor, who then remarked to him that nobody had every taken so few pictures on an assignment, before!
