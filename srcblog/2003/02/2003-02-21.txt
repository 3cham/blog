Title: Yes! Yes! Yes!

<b>Yes! Yes! Yes!</b>

At least once rotten american law system is put to good use: movie theather companies <a href="http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2003/02/20/news/local_illinois/6504a7237ae31d4486256cd2007c2118.txt">has been sued</a> for showing commercials before the movies. Yes, I go to movies a lot. Yes, I hate commercials (aka. "pre-show entertainment" that doesn't entertain at all). I'm paying up to $10 to see a movie and they have guts to keep me waiting for the movie showing useless crap that overfills TV programming anyway.
