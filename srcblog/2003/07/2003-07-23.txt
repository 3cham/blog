Title: Should I stay in software business.

<b>Should I stay in software business.</b> This seems to be a recurring topic in <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/">Joel On Software forums</a>: someone asks "IT doesn't look good. Should I stick being a programmer or switch to being a doctor/lawyer/whatever". <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/log-0037">This</a> should be a definitive answer.
