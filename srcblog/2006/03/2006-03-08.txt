Title: Pleasantly surprised by Microsoftâs documentation team

I was pleasantly surprised by Microsoftâs documentation team. Writing good technical documentation (e.g. API descriptions) is very hard and rarely do I see it done well.

One way to improve you documentation is by allowing readers to tell you about your mistakes and fix them. As simple as it concept seems, I donât see it implemented very often. Which is why I was positively surprised that Microsoft actually responded to the feedback Iâve sent them about lacking documentation of syntax for setting breakpoints in Platform Builder IDE.

All it took was clicking on an e-mail link inside help (*.chm) file. That opened default e-mail client with subject pre-filled with the location of the section I was complaining about. I wrote my thing and sent the e-mail. I wasnât expecting any response, but it did come. I was notified that the owner of this topic was notified and even got an updated version from the writer.

Looking at msdn website it seems like this feature exists but isnât consistent (e.g. thereâs a âSend comments on this topicâ link for C# docs or Windows API docs but not for Windows Mobile docs so thereâs still room for improvement.
