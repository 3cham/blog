Title: Inscape mini-review

More an impression than a mini-review.

<a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inscape</a> is an open-source vector drawing program. Think Illustrator.

I've tried the Windows version. My only frame of reference is Illustrator and even that only used a couple of times. I'm not a graphic person but I had to draw a logo so I decided to give Inscape a spin.

It worked surprisingly well. As expected I was confused at first by all the differences from the Illustrator but I quickly got the basics.

I was positively surprised that some of the basic things (like resizing) were done better than in Illustrator (at least in my opinion). I was able to export to plain svg format that I could import in Illustrator.

Inscape has all the basic features. Illustrator, not surprisingly, is much more capable and many things are done better (for example, saving an illustration as an image has a preview in Illustrator).

To conclude, I was able to design my simple thing. I can't say how well would Inkscape work for more complex design tasks.
