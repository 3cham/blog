Title: Yet another embedable language

 I thought I knew about them all, but no, I just found another one: <a title="Pawn" href="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm">Pawn</a>.<br><br>Pawn is C-like language intended as an embeddable scripting language for writing extensions for your C code. Not that we need yet another one.<br><br>I've only skimmed the website, but it looks fairly interesting. It's being maintained, it comes with zlib license (i.e. open-source and can be used in commercial apps), compiles to p-code (i.e. virtual machine), has interpreter for p-code, optimized interpreter written in assembly as well as JIT interpreter. It works under Windows and Unix. I would check it out (as an alternative to lua or python) if I was writing an app that needs an embeddable scripting language.<br><br>
