Title: RocketDock - Mac OS X Doc for Windows

Just a software plug for <a href="http://www.punksoftware.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&Itemid=143">RocketDock</a>.

Yes, it's just a clone of Mac OS X's Dock.

Yes, some people think that Dock should die.

I, howerver, found that it works well and is actually the best of many Windows app launchers that I've tried so far (including 2 other Dock clones). And it's free. 

What else could you ask for?

Ok, maybe the source code, so that I can add features that tickle my fancy (not that  I ever do that).

Or some basic performance monitoring applets (cpu, memory, battery, network i/o, sound volume etc.) so that I can get rid of <a href="http://www.winbar.nl/">WinBar</a>.

Or fixing a bug where RocketDock messes up the cmd.exe window (it cannot be moved using the title bar, copy&paste also doesn't work).
