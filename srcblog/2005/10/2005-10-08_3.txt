Title: Google Reader first impressions

  Google Reader</a>. Bashing is good when it has meat in it. Instead of history
  lessons in spreadsheets he should rather point out specific things that suck.
</p>
<p>
  So, does it suck or not? In my personal, although limited experience it's ok.
  I'm a FeedDemon turned Bloglines user. I've imported my 300+
  <a href="http://bloglines.com/" title="Bloglines">Bloglines</a>&nbsp;subscriptions
  into <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" title="Google Reader">Google
  Reader</a> and I've been using it for the past 2 days to read news.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Performance problems people were complaining about seem to&nbsp;be gone.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  An interesting thing is that the design of the application changes how you use
  it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  In Bloglines, I would mostly use mouse and do a topical-based scanning i.e. I
  would scan the list of subscriptions with unread items on the left, click on
  those I find the most interesting at&nbsp;the time. Then I would scan all the
  posts from a given source. I would do that because it comes natural given
  Bloglines design.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Main page of Google Reader is more or less random selection of items from all
  subscriptions so I just scan them sequentially, using keyboard shortcuts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  So is it good or bad? That's not the right question. The good question is:
  will I switch from Bloglines to Google Reader like I switched from FeedDemon
  to Bloglines? I don't know yet. I'm still experimenting but 2 days is not
  enough to tell if Google Reader suits me better than Bloglines.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  A few random Bloglines vs. Google Reader smackdowns.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Google Reader confuses me in a way Bloglines doesn't. In Bloglines I always
  know how many feeds are unread. In Google Reader my main page shows 0 unread
  items but when I go to a pages for a specific feed, it shows plenty of unread
  items. I just don't get it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Starring in GR is better than filing a clipping in Bloglines.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Unsubscribe in GR is flaky.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  I like that Bloglines shows how many people are subscribed to a given blog - a
  good way to measure my blog's popularity.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  "Gmail this" crashed my FireFox one time I tried to use it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Telling me "Item 11 of of more than X" isn't very helpful. I want to know an
  exact number of unread items I have.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Both Bloglines and GR seem to have a problem (by my definition of a problem)
  of posting the same entries after they got a minor update. Now, technically
  you might put the blame on faulty RSS generators or bloggers who like to touch
  their old posts for no apparent reason but I would sure like an option "don't
  show minor edits" which would hide posts that I've read and only got a minor
  update of the content. How do you define minor update? I don't know but I'm
  sure such problems isn't too big for an army of Ph.Ds.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  It would also be nice if GR gave more screen estate to the post itself.
  Currently the distance between the top of the window and the beginning of the
  post text is too big - it's a wasted space.
