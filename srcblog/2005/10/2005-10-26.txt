Title: Petzold on Visual Studio and mind corruption

Interesting article by Charles Petzold (the author of THE Windows programming book) where he <a title="ruminates on Visual Studio" href="http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">ruminates on Visual Studio</a>.<br>
<br>
Good article; I like his observation about IntelliSense forcing a bottom-up programming.<br>
