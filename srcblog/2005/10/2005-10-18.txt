Title: TextDrive.com could use some improvements.


For my low-end web hosting needs and hosting svn repositories I use <a title="TextDrive.com" href="http://textdrive.com">TextDrive.com</a>.
They do have a good rep on the internet, mostly due to their
involvement with various open-source, mostly Ruby-based, projects.<br>
<br>
There's one area of their hosting service that could use a lot of
improvements: webmin interface for managing the server. To be more
specific.<br>
<br>
1. It's agonizingly slow. It always has been.<br>
<br>
2. The UI is awful, and I mean the interaction, not being pretty. This
is the third time I've added a new subversion repository and tried to
setup anonymous access to it. You would think that this would be
possible from the same page that lists the repositories but that's not
how the mind of the brilliant designer of webmin works. It took me
(again) 15 minutes of clicking on every possible link to figure out
that in order to assign a given user access right to a svn repository,
you have to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>go the the virtual server configuration page</li>
  <li>click on "Edit Mail Users". Mail! How could I miss the fact that
setting up subversion repository access is done through editing mail
users.</li>
  <li>click on the user</li>
  <li>setup subversion access</li>
</ul>
<br>
So if you have multiple users, you have to do it over and over again
(as opposed to have all users listed next to repository name and being
able to do it in one step for all users).<br>
<br>
And every new page takes forever to render.<br>
<br>
The end result being that setup changes are very frustrating.<br>
<br>
