Title: A book to read, talks to listen to

"Producing Open Source Software" by Karl Fogel looks like a book I need to read. It's <a title="available for free on-line" href="http://producingoss.com/">available for free on-line</a>.<br>
<br>
I just finished listening to mp3 recordings of <a title="a few talks" href="http://startupschool.infogami.com/Presentations">a few talks</a>  from Paul Graham's Startup School. So far I've listened to talks by Paul Graham, Olin Shivers and Steve Wozniak. Recommended.<br>
