Title: Web 2.0 AJAX Quicken, anyone?




In this age of Web 2.0 AJAXed editors, e-mail clients and spreadsheets,
how come no-one came up with a Web 2.0-based replacement for Quicken?
Shouldn't be harder to write than an editor.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the only reason to write this post is so that I can test <a title="http://www.writely.com" href="http://www.writely.com">writely.com</a> integration with my WordPress-based weblog.<br>
<br>
Update: and what do you know, it worked!<br>
