Title: Publish your word documents on the web with writely

<a title="Writely" href="http://writely.com">Writely</a> can be used
for easy publishing of Word documents on the web. Select "Upload"
button at the top, find your word doc, upload, publish and voila - it's
on the web and you can link to it. I think Writely does a good job at
converting word to HTML. As an example, I've converted a very useful <a title="introduction to ARM assembly" href="http://www.writely.com/View.aspx?docid=a4kq8k5w7nf">introduction to ARM assembly</a> that someone wrote but only published as a word doc.<br>
