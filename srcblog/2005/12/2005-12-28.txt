Title: Another lesson in entrepreneurship

 <p>Gus Mueller, an author of a few simple Mac apps (<a title="VoodooPad" href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a>   and <a title="FlySketch" href="http://flyingmeat.com/flysketch/">FlySketch</a>) wrote an article on <a title="How to become an independent programmer in just 1068 days." href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html" name="1401">How to become an independent programmer in just 1068 days.</a> Interesting if you're into those kinds of stories.</p><br><p>They confuse me, though. The stories, I mean. His lesson #1 is "Think small and make sure you really like what you are doing". I can bet that I've read someone else's lessons that claim exactly the opposite: that you should aim high.</p><p><br></p><p>In the meantime, <a title="writely.com" href="http://writely.com">writely.com</a>   becomes worse and worse, instead of better and better. When writing this post I got into state where every new text was a hyperlink and I just couldn't tell writely otherwise. It acquired definitely weird and obvious strange behaviours. Few days ago I tried to blockquote some text in a document created in the past but writely kept ignored me. Looks like they should spend more time QA'ing the editor as all those changes are regressions from previously fine behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
