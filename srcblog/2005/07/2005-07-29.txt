Title: Longhorn/Vista fonts

Probably won't last long, but you can download new fonts included with Vista (Longhorn) <a href="http://test.uxevolutions.info/zoronax/entries/10">here</a>.

I took a quick look at monospaced font "Consola" (for source code editing) and it looks good (although to really make an informed opinion about a font, I would have to live with it for some time).
