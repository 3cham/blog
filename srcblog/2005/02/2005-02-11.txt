Title: Explanation of U.S. cell-phone mobile data plans.

Trying to figure out available data plans (very useful for advanced cell-phone that can use internet connectivity) for U.S. cell-phone carriers based on their websites is usually painful and confusing.

Thank god for <a href="http://twelveblackcodemonkeys.blog-city.com/read/1050881.htm">this comparison</a> of data plans on major U.S. carriers. An article that I wanted to write myself but don't have to now.

Personally, I have both Sprint and T-Mobile accounts with unlimited data plans ($15/month Sprint and $30/month on T-Mobile (would be only $20 if I also got voice plan)).
