Title: 2 great books and one not so great.

A good book grips you and forces you&nbsp; to keep reading until you're done. Steve Wozniak's "<a href="http://www.iwoz.org/book">iWoz</a>" and Jessica Livingston's "<a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders at work</a>" are such books.<br /><br />Wozniak's book is inspirational for an engineer and shows how passion and hard work leads to creating great products and making lots of money.<br /><br />Livingston's book is inspirational for an entrepreneur and shows how passion and hard work (sometimes) leads to creating great products and making lots of money.<br /><br />The book I was disappointed by is Scott Rosenberg's "<a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/">Dreaming in code</a>". I bought it because it promised to describe the behind-the-scenes story of <a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org/">Chandler</a>, a project I was interested in. And the parts that did that - I liked. However, it also had large sections on tangential issues about the business of creating software that might be interesting to some but weren't to me (mostly because I already knew about all that other stuff).<br />
