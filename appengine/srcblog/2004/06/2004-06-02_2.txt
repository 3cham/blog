Title: Patterns in interaction design (web and gui design pattern)

Even the smallest of web applications face the same design issues that were solved thousand of times: designing a login and registration screens, navigation scheme, searching, shopping cart etc. A person facing such problem has two options:
<ul>
<li>re-invent the wheel, most likely coming up with a wheel that is inferior to some of the existing wheels
<li>research prior art and implement the best existing solution
</ul>

<a href="http://www.welie.com/index.html">Patterns in Interaction Design</a> website is immensly helpful if one chooses the "research prior art" option. It's a very good, categorized collection of solutions to such common problems (patterns) for web and gui design (web section is much bigger than gui section). The value of the site:
<ul>
<li>gathers all this information in one place
<li>provides good categorization of patterns
<li>each pattern is described in concise and regular manner; pattern description states the problem a given pattern solves as well as the solution
</ul>
This website is an invaluable resource to any web designer and web developer. If it was used more often we would have less broken web interfaces.
