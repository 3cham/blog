Title: Bait and switch?

<del><a href="http://www.sinelogic.com/">Sinelogic</a> claims to offer free PDF e-book about design on a budget. In order to download it you have to provide an e-mail address and they send you a download link which, they claim, should be valid for 24 hours. However, I accessed it within 1 hour and all I got was: "Sorry, the requested download has expired."</del>

<del>Sorry, indeed. That looks like dishonest business practice and I'm not sure that I should give them benefit of the doubt given that after sending them an e-mail about the problem, I didn't get any response</del>

<b>Update:</b> Sinelogic folks noticed this post and sent me an e-mail explaining that they did have problems with the download system, which they fixed, and my e-mail to them was probably lost due to being flagged as spam (which happens). They've also sent me the PDF.

It's nice that they took the time to address this, so kudos to them.
