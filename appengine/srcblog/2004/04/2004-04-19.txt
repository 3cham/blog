Title: Psyco - effortless, significant speedup of Python programs.

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> using <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">psyco</a> is an 
<a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/node8.html">easy way</a>
to get a 9x speedup for real-life Python program.</p>

<p>I just wrote a Python program that took quite a while to complete.
It was reading a 600 MB *.sql file (uncompressed 
<a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/">Wikipedia database dump</a>, parsing it
to extract some fields and writing the result to a text file for
easier processing in the future). While it's not a production code it is 
important for me. Currently Python is my favorite language for writing 
non-GUI code because of ease of development and rich libraries. The only 
sore point is its speed, or lack of it but I will always trade CPU cycles for 
programming cycles. There are efforts to speed up Python code and one of 
them is <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">psyco</a>. I've heard about it before 
but never tried in practice so I decided to give the latest version (1.2) 
a try. Setup (on Windows XP, Python 2.3.2) was a breeze. All it takes to 
use psyco is to <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/node8.html">add 2 lines to your 
program</a>. What about 
the results? I achieved 9.67 speed up which is great. When, for benchmarking 
purposes, I limited the processing to only 10.000 (out of around 360.000) 
records, the processing time dropped from 301.19 seconds 
to 31.12 seconds. That's a big win and makes a real difference when 
processing the whole file. Go psyco!</p>

<p>Standard benchmark warning: "there are lies, damn lies and benchmarks". My 
app is different than yours so it might get better or worse speedup from 
psyco. Having said that, the app in question is non-trivial, real-life app 
(i.e. it's not a micro-benchmark designed to test a specific feature) so I 
think it's fair to say that psyco can give a serious speed up to a large 
class of python apps. It seems to be stable and is extremely easy to use.</p>

<p>I would post the code so that people could independently verify the 
results but currently it takes too much effort to upload files to my blog. 
Sorry about that.</p>
