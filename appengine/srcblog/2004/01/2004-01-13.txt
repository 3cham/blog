Title: WinExpose and stealing ideas.

<b>WinExpose and stealing ideas.</b>
I'll never understand <a href="http://gigaom.com/archives/2004/01/copycats_everywhere.html">people whining</a> about "ripping off" or "stealing" ideas. Someone implemented functional equivalent of Mac OS X built-in feature called Expose and that's apparently a bad thing. It's bad, because... well, just because, I guess. Yes, some guy inside Apple came up with this idea first. Does that mean that WinExpose guys didn't work hard to implement that on Windows? They did work hard. Does that mean that such feature should forever be banned from Windows (or any non-Apple OS, for that matter, including Linux/X-Windows)? What if we apply similar thinking in reverse and ban any technology/idea that happened to be implemented on Windows first from ever being implemented on any non-Windows OS? Where does this "thou shall not use other people's ideas" rule gets us? It gets us nowhere. It gets us to a place where software doesn't evolve because no-one can improve anything because to improve something you first have to copy the original idea. How those Netscape folks dared to copy Mozaic and make it better? Ok, they're excused because some of the guys that started Netscape worked on Mozaic (but not all Mozaic devs became Netscape devs and not all Netscape devs were Mozaic devs). But all others cheaters with no original idea in their brain are not excused. That includes Microsoft (IE), Apple (Safari), Mozilla (ok, they emerged from Netscape, but even if we were to be charitable because of that, they should be dismantled once Netscape stopped producing Netscape) and numerous, too many to mention, folks working on open-source browsers. Actually, I've changed my mind about Mozaic. They're also a bunch of chaps without an original thought in their brain - after all what they did is just an implementation of ideas of Tim-Berners Lee. He should be the only one allowed to implement it - anyone else doing that is clearly just stealing his ideas, ripping him off. And that newspaper thing, I'm sure someone was first to came up with the idea. Why do we have hundreds of competing newspapers and magazines? Because we have hundreds (minus one) bastards without a creative thought in their minds that shamelessly stollen the idea. May they rot in hell.

<a href="http://www.winexpose.com/">WinExpose</a> folks should be applauded for:
<ul>
  <li>good business sense (porting apps that proven to be successful on one platform to another platform is as good of a business plan as it gets; I wonder why people don't do it more often)
  <li>providing an utility that people might find useful and if they do, they'll fork their money over to WinExpose makers making them rich and that's how healthy market should work
</ul>
