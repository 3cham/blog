Title: First VMWare disappointement.

<b>First VMWare disappointement.</b>

Given than my computer happily reboots when I try to run SmartPhone emulator (not a very good video driver). So I thought that I would run this under VMWare but no luck. VMWare refused with a message of something being unimplemented. Oh well.
