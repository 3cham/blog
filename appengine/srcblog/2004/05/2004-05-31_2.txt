Title: Lisp failed as a programming language.

The proof is in the pudding. Despite everything nice that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> and other Lisp advocates have to say about how great Lisp is, it failed as a programming language. Ultimate proof: <a href="http://jabberwocky.sourceforge.net/">Jabberwocky</a>. It's a Lisp IDE, presumably written by people who know and love coding in Lisp.

It's written in Java.
