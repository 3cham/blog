Title: Treo killer or a copy-cat?

<b>Treo killer or a copy-cat?</b> <a href="http://engadget.com">Engadget</a> has <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833089/">just posted</a> a picture of BENQ P50 Pocket PC phone. They call it a "Treo killer" but to my eyes it looks more like a "Treo copy-cat". Not that I think it's bad - I fully support using other people's ideas to create improved products (even if I wouldn't support it, realistically that's how things get developed anyway). From the picture it's hard to tell how big it is compared to Treo 600 but otherwise it looks very much like Treo 600. So the question is: given the little information we have, is it going to be a Treo 600 killer? Let's see:<ul><li>it's unclear if it's a phone at all. Reports so far mention wi-fi and bluetooth but they don't mention any GSM or other phone standard. They do mention using Pocket PC Phone Edition. If it's not a phone, it's not even a competition.<li>pro: wi-fi, bluetooth and a bigger screen (probably a 240x320, standard on Pocket PC, as compared to 160x160 on Treo)<li>con: late to market. It'll be months before it'll be available to customers.<li>con: Palm OS is still ahead of Pocket PC in terms of market share. More apps for Treo 600.<li>unknown: one of the Treo's strengths is improved software. Handspring took Palm OS and modified it quite extensively to support Treo's hardware like keyboard and 5-way navigator. It remains to be seen if BENQ did the same for P50, but my guess is not.</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
So I wouldn't name Treo's killer just yet.
