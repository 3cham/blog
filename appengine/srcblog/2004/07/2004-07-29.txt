Title: IronPython finally released.

<a href="http://ironpython.org">IronPython</a> is a Python implementation targetting CLR (i.e. .NET platform as implemented by Microsoft or mono).

Interesting tidbits:
<ul>
<li>it's 1.7x faster than Python 2.3 on standard benchmark (although supposedly only barely faster on real-life examples)
<li>the author has been hired by Microsoft to work on CLR team where he'll continue improving CLR support for dynamic languages with IronPython being a test-bed but production-quality implementation
</ul>
Things get really interesting!
