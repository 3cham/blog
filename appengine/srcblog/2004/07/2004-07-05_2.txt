Title: Talks from BREW conference.
BREW is just another OS/platform for smartphones (i.e. phones that can do more). I don't believe in BREW - it's a controlled platform (owned by Qualcomm) and in my opinion the future belongs to open platforms like Palm, MS Smartphone, Symbian or Java. However, Qualcomm did at least one thing very well: all talks from their developers conference are <a href="http://brew.qualcomm.com/brew/en/press_room/events/brew_2004/brew_2004.html">available on-line</a>. Technical talks about BREW aren't interesting for non-BREW developers but they also had a lot of talks about phone business in general which are worth watching.


Just don't fall for their "close is good" propaganda as presented e.g. in "Transforming Imagination Into Profitable Services" talk (linked <a href="http://brew.qualcomm.com/brew/en/press_room/events/brew_2004/pres_video_01.html">from here</a>). The talk was given by Brazil's most succseful mobile operator Vivo. At one point the presenter talks about "openness vicious circle" by listing all the bad things that happen on Internet because it's open:
<ul>
<li>a lot of trash, lousy content</li>
<li>therefore good stuff gets lost in the noise</li>
<li>intrusive advertising and spam as a business model</li>
</ul>
And that's true: this is the price to pay for being open. Being close, however, is not an answer, because the big and really important advantage of being open is that people can innovate. Along with all the junk on the Internet, there are also plenty of wonderful services and many of them would not happen in a closed, stricly for profit environment (<a href="http://wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a> comes to mind but I could spend hours enumerating web sites that are useful yet probably wouldn't happen on a closed platform.

Remember: carriers want control because that's a way to <a href="../../../2004/06/24/the-danger-of-carrier-control.html">easy money</a>. Mind you: not the biggest amount of money, just easy, effortless money. It's a short-sighted thinking that makes them protect their SMS and ringtones revenues by blocking competitive technologies and they end up blocking the technology that would bring them even more money. They can see their current revenues, they can see the threat to those revenues but they can't see the reward of the next great thing.

In a way it's justified: the next great thing simply isn't visible. You have to take on faith that it'll come. However, people running those companies are not idiots, they are just blinded. They should study the history a bit which gives plenty examples of the next great thing.

Movie studios feared that VCRs would kill their movie business and tried to kill VCR. Movie business is bigger than it was before and VCR doubled the revenue by creating a new home watching business (not to mention collateral sales of better home-theater systems). 

And the "vicious circle of Internet"? Give me a break - the amount of new money generated by Internet is staggering. It could only happen because Internet was open. Compare Internet to French system Minitel. In principle, its purpose was the same: a way to provide information to people. You had a terminal (keyboard + louse monitor) attached to a phone line. You had to pay monthly fees and could access information services (for additional services). The thing shipped before Internet and was quite popular in France. Where is it now? It's dead. It couldn't keep up with Internet. The technology was closed, controlled by France Telecom and was not upgraded. The protocol was hardwired. The terminal had fixed hardware requirements. At the time of the launch Minitel was way ahead of Internet. Their character-based monitor was comparable to PC monitors of the time. The speeds were ok (especially given that services were optimized for low-bandwidth). France Telecom was making easy money. Service providers were making easy money.

But when a competition (Internet) showed up, they just couldn't keep up. The hardware quickly became a joke compared to a PC with 21'' LCD screen. The phone-line speeds quickly became a joke compared to DSL speeds. The amount of available services quickly became a joke compared to the richness of the Internet.

Internet was open. Minitel was closed. Minitel generated easy money for some time for those lucky enough to be involved. Internet generated much more money for anyone who had a good idea and provided a lot of stuff for free that was unavailable anywhere else.

Minitel died. Internet thrives.

Draw your own conclusions.
