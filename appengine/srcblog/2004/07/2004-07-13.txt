Title: Marketing as skillful lying - part deux.

<a href="http://www.jackito-pda.com/hardware/overview.php">Jackito</a> is a new PDA by some French startup company. Looks decent but obviously doesn't have a tiny chance in the crowded marketplace. It doesn't offer anything substantially better than Palm OS, Pocket PC or Symbian - and those are established players backed by large companies.

What drew my attention was <a href="http://www.jackito-pda.com/hardware/overview.php">this marketing overview</a>. It says: "The only one with a such larger screen". While "large" might be interpreted in many ways, it's screen resolution is only 240x320 - the same as Pocket PC, two times smaller than many Palm PDAs (Tapwave Zodiac, many CLIE models and some Tungsten's have 320x480), not to mention Toshiba's Pocket PC with 800x600.

So, lies, all lies, nothing but the lies.

Oh, and according to some Slashdot posts it's just a thick-plotted scam. They do have a nice website, though. Which prooves that on the Internet, no one knows, that you're a dog.
