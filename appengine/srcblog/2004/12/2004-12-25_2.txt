Title: Treo 650 better than SX66

I think SX66 is much cooler, more mysterious name than Treo 650 but according to <a href="http://forums.attwireless.com/attws/board/message?board.id=palm&message.id=1723">a person that used them both</a>, Treo 650 is a better phone. Here's what that person says:
<blockquote>
The SX66 is definitely more PDA than phone. The Treo650 works well as a phone and while on paper the size difference wouldn't seem that huge, in real life the Treo fits in a front jeans pocket and the SX66 doesn't. Another PDA centric nit for the SX66 is that is doesn't display the battery meter on the today screen or phone screen. In my use, the Treo also has much better battery life (larger screen on the SX66 probably hurts).

If you don't mind using a Bluetooth headset and carrying the SX66 in a belt case, it makes an OK phone. It doesn't hold calls as well as the Treo and RF reception is not as good. The Treo is a loud phone. I end up cranking the volume down and at times the microphone picks up nearby conversations. The SX66 sounds OK but called parties often complain that the sound is thin or muted. The Treo can be used as a phone pretty easily without having to leverage the touch screen. Even most PDA functions can be done without leveraging the touch screen. The SX66 is too frustrating to use without the touch screen.

The slide out keyboard on the SX66 isn't as easy to type on as the raise keys of the Treo and it takes two hands to slide out (unless you want to press hard on the touch screen). I find that I don't use the keyboard much on the SX66 and end up with a lot of finger prints on the screen (try getting the stylus out with one hand when your in a hurry).

The SX66 does have some advantages (large screen, ActiveSync over GPRS, Wi-Fi, etc.). Both benefit from third party software to make them more useful.
