Title: SMART Goals

Recently I've read tons of books on how to become more effective, how 
to achieve more. They don't always agree on the answer but there's 
one thing they all agree: you have to set goals. Goals should be 
<b>SMART</b>. They should be:
<UL>
<LI><b>S</b>pecific</li>
<LI><b>M</b>easurable</li>
<LI><b>A</b>chievable</li>
<LI><b>R</b>esults oriented</li>
<LI><b>T</b>ime-bound</li>
</UL>
Do you set yourself goals? What do you want to achieve in the next 
week, next month, next year, next 5 years?
