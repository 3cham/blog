Title: Our job, as writers

<a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/">Rushkoff says</A>:

<blockquote>Our job, as writers, is to live the most fascinating life 
we can muster. We have to be willing to have the experiences that 
others are afraid to pursue. Then, we pay back the world for letting 
us have these experiences by sharing them, in writing. . That's the 
deal.</blockquote>
