Title: Six Degrees unleashed

I've installed a 30-day demo version of <A href="http://www.creo.com/sixdegrees/">SixDegrees</A>. The product has been hyped quite succesfully, but my experience so far has been negative. At startup it was supposed to grab messages from Outlook. After working hard for a few minutes it didn't. New messages, however, are showing up. </P>&#013;&#010;<P>Another thing is that apparently it's written in Java, which makes it very slow. The startup time is unberable and the app itself is slow (on a 1.2 GHz Dell laptop with 1 GB of memory) although I can understand betting on Moore's laws. &#013;&#010;<P>As to the functionality, it looks like it's doing very simple data mining of e-mails, extracting names and building indexes that correlate e-mail messages with people and files. But since it failed to import my data it's hard to tell if it's useful or not. I'll keep using it to see if it's helpful when the amount of messages grows.
