Title: My first impressions are good
Draft: 1

My first impressions are good. After creating new post it appears immediately on the public web site hosted by Userland. I don't have such luck with the template yet. I've changed it, I can see it on my local&nbsp;web server&nbsp;but it's not updated in public site. Can it be that this option doesn't work on trial copy?
