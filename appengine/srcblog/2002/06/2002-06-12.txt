Title: How to subvert patent system.

We all know that patents are harmful to society, they take away the freedom to innovate and discover. They stop progress with red tape and allow monopolies to easily grow and use existing resources to futher their monopolies. To make matters worse, we are forced to pay our taxes so that this money can be used to harm us. Read <A href="http://www.eetimes.com/issue/bus/OEG20020604S0037">this article</A>. It claims that PTO might save $500 million by restructuring. That means that taxpayers have to pay many times as much to keep PTO alive and kicking (the american society). That's a lot of money that could be used to find cure for HIV. Or many other things that would actually benefit the public.</P>&#013;&#010;<P>So here's my idea of subverting the patent system: flood the suckers with stupid patterns. Don't care about quality, go for quantity. Ok, it's not like it hasn't been done: there are enough greedy, short-sighted people to flood PTO with stupid patterns and PTO is more than happy to award them but what I propose is to take this to the next level. Let's file 10 times more patents, 100 times more, even a 1000 times more. Someday someone will realize that this system just cannot work and is doing much more harm that supposed good.&#013;&#010;<P>The only problem is that patent application costs money but if it wasn't I would be generating patents like crazy and submiting them to PTO. Let them drown in the sea of papers.
