Title: Buffered blogging.

The hard part about blogging is keeping the pace. Blogging is a marathon, not a sprint. That number on a calendar without corresponding link is the worst thing that can happen to a blog. So here it comes: Buffered Blogging TM (patent pending, of course). The idea is simple: have a few pre-written entries and have an automated system to post them if there are no post on a given day. Preparing a few posts in advance is easy. Automated posting shouldn't be that hard to do either in some systems (e.g. Movable Type). Probably just a bit of hacking. Or someone could provide a web service that would allow people to create a bunch of blog entries and would post them automatically using <A href="http://plant.blogger.com/api/index.html">Blogger API</A> if it would detect that there were no post that day on a given blog.
