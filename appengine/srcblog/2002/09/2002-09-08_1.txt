Title: We don't need Intellectual Property (that much)

I couldn't <A href="http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-09-01.html">say it</A> better. A thought for today: a popular assertion exists that if there is no legal protection for various forms of so-called "Intellectual" so-called "Property" (copyrights for books, music etc., patents for inventions) there will be no new more books, music, inventions created. 

This is baloney. 

It is a fact that people wrote books and composed music long before any copyright protection was available. 

It is a fact that there is an increasing amount of software written where people deliberately give up the rights they get automatically. 

Imagine that! They make additional effort to give up the "rights" they were given because they think those rights don't serve them well.
