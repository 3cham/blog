Title: My new Pocket PC.

<B>My new Pocket PC.</B> I just got Toshiba Pocket PC e310. It looks nice but my overall impression that the whole industry is still so immature. Something like a car industry at the time of Ford T. Clunky and imperfect. Requiring too much attention and knowledge to operate well. Those things are supposed to seamlessly integrate into people's lives and not be just another annoyance requiring constant care and attention. Here's one example of this immaturity. I'm installing Active Sync (a software that enables transferring data between my PC and my Pocket PC). It has the following warning: &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=red>Important Note</FONT> Before installing ActiveSync, ensure your Pocket PC cradle is not yet connected to your computer. Connect the cradle only after you have finished installing ActiveSync. </BLOCKQUOTE>This is a ridiculous requirement. Not to mention that the note is just scary. What will happen if I miss the notice and will have my cradle connected before? WillI receive an electric shock for not following manufacturer's instructions, will the world disappear ? Or maybe nothing will happen and this note is "just in case". Those things have a long time to go.
