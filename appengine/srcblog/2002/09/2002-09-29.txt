Title: Deconstructing Palm.

<b>Deconstructing Palm.</b>
PalmSource (a Palm Inc. spin-off company that now drives development of Palm OS while the original
Palm Inc. switched to only doing hardware) has a <a
href="http://www.palmsource.com/palmos/">marketing blurb</a> which is,
as marketing blurbs usually have it, full of half-truths and outrageous lies. 
Let's deconstruct it.<blockquote><i>
Today, the Palm OS runs on almost two out of every three handhelds
</i></blockquote>
In other words it has less than 66% of market share. What they don't tell you is 
that they had more than 90% not so long ago and that their market
share continues to decline, assaulted by PDAs based on Windows CE
(Pocket PC) OS.
<p>
<blockquote><i>
Why has the Palm OS achieved its remarkable leadership role? ... 
In handheld computing, user needs vary tremendously from person to
person, and from department to department ... The Palm OS is the only
handheld operating system that can satisfy all these different needs
many more. ThatÂ’s because the Palm OS is built to support a wide
variety of devices with a single, consistent software platform.
</i></blockquote>
This falls into "blatant lie" category. Palm OS, up until the latest
released version 4.1 is the most inflexible OS you can imagine. Every
hardware maker that made products that Palm OS was not designed for
had to add its own extensions (additional APIs) to the OS. Those
extensions are very poorly supported by existing software so they might just as 
well not exist. For example, Palm OS is fixed to 160x160
resolution. Sony and Handera produced PDAs based on Palm OS with
higher resolution screens but, as stated above, they had to modify (i.e. hack) 
the OS and add their own APIs. Did Palm learn from their past mistakes? Hardly. 
Upcoming Palm OS 5 is fixed to 2 resolutions: 320x320 and 160x160.<blockquote><i>
Supporting the same range of hardware as Palm OS using Microsoft
software would mean deploying two or three different software
platforms Pocket PC, Windows CE, and Stinger significantly
different software compatibility, interfaces, user training, and
custom development required for each.
</i></blockquote>
This statement relies heavily on the ignorance of the reader. The
differences between Pocket PC, Windows CE and Stinger are very small,
not "significant". Furthermore they implement a subset of Win32 APIs
which means that any Windows programmer (and there's a lot of them) can be quickly 
trained for programming Pocket PCs. In contrast, every programmer has to learn 
Palm OS programming from scratch (except Mac programmers given that Palm OS is, 
shall we say, heavily influenced by the old Mac OS).<blockquote><i>
The huge Palm OS community has also created wide choice in add-on
hardware, ranging from digital cameras, to MP3 players, cell phone,
GPS, and high-speed LAN connectivity (802.11b).
</i></blockquote>
MP3s can be played natively by any Pocket PC. Overall, Palm
OS-based hardware lags behind the Pocket PC-based because Pocket PCs
have support for CF slot (which gives all those GPS and LAN
connectivity capabilities). But that won't stop marketers from alluding
that Palm OS is superior in that area.  
<blockquote><i>
From the very first Palm Pilot, the designers of Palm OS have sweated
the details of how a mobile product actually gets used, and how to
make that usage simple and lightning fast. 
</i></blockquote>
According to the book "Piloting Palm" this is actually true: Hawkins
was obsessed (in a good way) with making a good designed. Too bad he
doesn't work at Palm anymore.
<blockquote><i>
The Palm operating system software was designed just for mobile
devices. It uses memory and battery power very efficiently, enabling
Palm Powered hardware makers to design extremely small and lightweight
systems.
</i></blockquote>
This is also true. However, the point becomes more and more
moot. Latest Pocket PC-based devices (like Toshiba e370) rival Palm
OS-based in terms of the size. The design decision that proved winning
during past 7 years (first Palm devices appeared in 1996) is now
holding Palm back and if they don't do something soon they will be
eaten alive by an alliance of Microsoft's Pocket PC and Moore's
law. The battle now is
in the features. People demand more and whoever will fill that demand
will win.
