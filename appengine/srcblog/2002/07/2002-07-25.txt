Title: The end of the free

An excellent site <A href="http://www.lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</A> has just 
<A href="http://lwn.net/Articles/5409/">announced</A> that, barring immediate 
miracles, they're closing shop on August 1. 
<p>Those are bad news - LWN has been an 
excellent site providing weekly pro-Linux, pro-open source and anti-Microsoft news 
with excellent, thoughtful commentary. </p>

<p>This event, as sad as it is, illustrates a 
very simple economical principle: you cannot make money on something that can be 
obtained for free.</p>

<p>The cost is not directly related to quality. Despite being truly 
best-of-the-web, popular and running on a tight budget, the people involved cannot 
find a way to pay the bills. The magazine has been running for some time on the 
dot-com wave when everybody thought that Internet was a goose laying golden eggs 
but when the reality kicked in the numbers says that the site cannot turn a profit. 
</p>

<p>Donations have been tried but it seems that even popular site with loyal and 
sympathetic readers cannot make enough money that way to stay in business. And no 
other option seems to be in the sight. </p>

<p>This is also a main problem of open-source 
when it comes to making money: by definition of open-source you effectively have to 
give away the software for free. If people can get the software for free, they 
won't pay. Tom Lord, hard-working and excellent programmer, is <A 
href="http://www.regexps.com/">finding this out</A> the hard way. 
</p>

<p>I wish him luck, 
I wish LWN luck, but don't expect that they'll have it.
