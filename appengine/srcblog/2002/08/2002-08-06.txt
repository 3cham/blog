Title: The irony.

Qwest included an ad for caller id device in my latest phone bill. "Don't talk to strangers!", they tempt me. I find it ironic given that the only strangers that want to talk to me bought my number from Qwest. 

Not that I ever permitted Qwest to sell my number to anyone, they do it for fun and profit regardless of what their customers think about it. 

What's next? Doctors poisoning people so that they can sell treatment? 

Lawyers creating nightmarish laws so that people need to hire more lawyers... oh, wait, never-mind.
