Title: Fastmail
Draft: 1

<A href="http://www.fastmail.fm">Fastmail.fm</A> just got a facelift. The "Slimstream" display style looks great. If you're in need for a good POP3/IMAP/web-based e-mail service, fastmail.fm is highly recommended. Even SPAM is bearable if you configure SPAM rules correctly. I ended up in having bulk of my spam detected and moved to spam folder that I periodically clean up with a few clicks, 0 false positives (i.e. non-spam messages being marked as spam) and a few spam messages that still get into my Inbox (and most of them is not exactly spam but messages generated by viruses).
