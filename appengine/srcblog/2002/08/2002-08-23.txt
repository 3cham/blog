Title: Daemon tools for mounting iso images

I have a new tool in my toolbox: <A href="http://www.daemon-tools.com/daemon_tools.htm">Daemon Tools</A>. It allows you to mount CD ISO images as a hard drive. Read-only, of course. What's the use for that? My situation is: I have a RedHat 7.2 server running my web site. I need to administer it remotely which, among other things, means that if I need to install some additional RPM package, it's a pain because I don't have access to installation CDs on this machine. Instead of looking for the rpm on the net (which is little fun if all you have is a command line) I mount the original RedHat ISO images on my main Windows machine using Daemon Tools, I copy desired files to a remote computer using <A href="http://winscp.vse.cz/eng/">WinSCP</A> and use ssh client <A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</A> to login remotely and install the packages.
