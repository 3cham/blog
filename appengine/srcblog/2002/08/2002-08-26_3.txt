Title: Corel in trouble.
Draft: 1

No wonder <A href="http://www.corel.com/">Corel</A> is in trouble. I got interested in "digital creativity" tools and remembering that Corel Draw was a popular product I decided to check out what's new (given that my latest personal encounter with Corel Draw was at about version 3.0). And their web site is horrible. When I saw a flash intro my first thought was that I mistyped the URL. I wouldn't expect a software company to put a flash intro on their web page. Where was Corel's web team when everybody and their sisters were loudly condemning flash intros as evil for the last couple of years? And it doesn't get any better. It's hard to find detailed information about the software (I doubt there is something approaching detailed information on the site), etc. The site is just bad.
