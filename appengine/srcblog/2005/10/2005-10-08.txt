Title: Writely-in-a-weblog


Here are 2 things that I would like to see:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a title="writely.com" href="http://writely.com">writely.com</a>-like quality of weblog post editing in my weblog tool</li>
  <li>writely-like publishing integrated with my weblog</li>
</ul>
<br>
The first one is obvious: writely.com has much better editor gadget
than e.g. WordPress so it's not surprising that I would like WP to
improve so that it's as good as writely.<br>
<br>
But what I would also like is that weblog tools add some sort of
article publishing and collaboration. A weblog is a publishing tools
but every weblog tool maker seems to take a very narow view of what a
weblog is i.e. a chronological list of posts.<br>
<br>
Not everything that I would like to publish falls into this ephemeral
model. Some things deserve more permanent place. Currently I have a
separate page for articles but they're just static html pages that are
a pain to update and I had to add them manually to my site.<br>
<br>
In the past I've advocated integrating wiki-like features with weblogs
but now I think that writely-like features would be better.<br>
<br>
Wikis are best at large-scale collaboration and that's probably not
what most weblog users need. Writely.com focuses on making it easier to
write documents with simple formatting (truth be told, wiki syntax
isn't the easiest to learn and every wiki seems to have a need to
invent its own syntax) and small-scale collaboration (with just a few,
trusted people).<br>
<br>
To summarize, what I would like blogs to have:<br>
<ul>
  <li>an editory that matches <a title="writely.com" href="http://writely.com">writely.com</a> in quality</li>
  <li>extending blogs with "articles" section. Don't care about the
name, but the point is that this should be a place for non-temporal,
more permanent writings. A lengthy review. A book. A paper. An essay. A
programming article.</li>
  <li>ideally, collaborative editing of articles (and maybe even blog posts) a-la-writely</li>
</ul>
<br>
I'll switch to the first weblog that implements that engine. WordPress, MovableType, Blogger, Yahoo, MSN Spaces, do ya hear me?<br>
<br>
After all, it's crazy that I type this in writely just because editing in WordPress sucks so much.<br>
