Title: Gmail feature request - intelligent account selection for reply

In Gmail you can define multiple accounts i.e. different "from" e-mail
addresses. One of those addresses is a default address also used for
every 'reply' command.

'Reply' should observe to which account the e-mail was sent and use the same account for reply i.e. if I have two accounts:
<ul><li>foo@bar.com</li><li>bar@bar.com</li></ul>

If I reply to an e-mail sent to my 'foo@bar.com' account, Gmail should
automatically use my 'foo@bar.com' account for 'from' address, and if
it was sent to 'bar@bar.com', it should use 'bar@bar.com'.

Pretty please?
