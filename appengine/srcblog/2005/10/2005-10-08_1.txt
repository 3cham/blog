Title: Writely wishlist

I just discovered <a href="http://writely.com" title="Writely">Writely</a> and I
like it. I like it so much that I have only 2 feature requests.<br/>
<br/>
One is improvement to how links are edited. Here's a small test case:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>
    click on a link button</li>
  <li>
    enter link name and text</li>
  <li>
    type the rest of your text</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There are two bugs (by my definition of a bug):<br/>
<ul>
  <li>
    the cursor is at the beginning of the link, not the end</li>
  <li>
    even if I put the cursor at the end, whatever I type is still considered to
    be a part of the link text. That's not what I expect. It's pretty much
    impossible to convince writely to not make the text a part of the link (the
    only work-around I found was enter for new line, type something and then
    delete the newline). At the very least the logic should be: if I'm at the
    end of the link and press space, this becomes a body of the message, not the
    link</li>
</ul>
<br/>
And a feature request: source code highlighter. I often write posts in which I
would like to embed snippets of code. Those snippets of code are much more
readable if they're nicely formatted.<br/>
<br/>
I know, it's a very geeky feature. But then again, I assume a lot of writely
early adopters are geeks like me, that jump at the opportunity of playing with
the latest toys. So how about adding "Code snippet" to "Insert" drop-down? Or
maybe "Style" "Source code" =&gt; language.<br/>
