Title: Awesome nerdTV interview


There are <a title="some great interviews from nerdTV" href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/">some great interviews from nerdTV</a>
on-line. It looks like they just started. They only have 6 interviews
so far, but those are excellent interviews, with Andy Hertzfeld, Bill
Joy, Brewster Kahle, Tim O'Reilly, Dave Winer, all giants of computer
industry.<br>
<br>
I love Internet for exactly this reason: making available things that would otherwise not be available to me.<br>
