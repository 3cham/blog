Title: Bloglines vs. Google Reader - the verdict

I've been a Bloglines user for ages now. I gave Google Reader a fair
chance by using it exclusively for a few days but I've made my
decision: I'm going to remain a Bloglines user.<br>
<br>
Google Reader is fine and if Bloglines didn't exist I would probably be
using it. I really like how easy it is to star documents - it's one
advantage it still has over Bloglines.<br>
<br>
Where Bloglines wins big time is efficiency of reading a large number
of posts. Their layout where one frame has a list of unread feeds and
the other frame a list of all posts from this feed heavily beats
Google's "one post at a time" way, even when using keyboard navigation.
Google should add an option to read posts the Bloglines way.<br>
<br>
I subscribe to a few high-frequency-scan-only feeds (like freshmeat's
announcement feed) and marching through them one by one kills me.<br>
<br>
Also, Bloglines seems faster (something that Google can fix, given enough time, but it's not fixed yet).<br>
<br>
What I would like to see in Bloglines is a better way to preserve
specific posts i.e. a copy of the "star this post" feature. Currently I
use the "clip this" but it requires too many steps. All I need is a
"star this" link that works like "clip this" but without asking any
questions and showing me new windows with confirmation. Just do the job
and don't bother me.<br>
<br>
So far the upside for me from Google Reader is that Bloglines added keyboard navigation. Ain't competition grand.<br>
