Title: Where do bugs come from and how to avoid them.

It's frustrating that we, programmers, write bugs in our code.<br /><br />One way to figure out how to avoid writing bugs (or, more realistically, write less bugs) is to understand where do bugs come from.<br /><br />Recently I realized that there are only two sources of software bugs:<br /><ul><li>ignorance</li><li>carelessness<br /></li></ul>Probably not the greatest of insights, but I haven't seen it spelled out this way before.<br /><br />Since it seemed like a topic bigger than a blog post, I've written up a longer article about <a href="/articles/sourceOfBugs.html">where do bugs come from and how to avoid them</a>.<br />
