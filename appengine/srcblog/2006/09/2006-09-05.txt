Title: Writeboard hack: use Gmail for list of writeboards

<a href="http://writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a> is a free service from <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> for creating simple (and I really mean simple) documents and collaborating on them with other people. Basically, it's a simple, one-page wiki with an ugly font (curier, that defies Windows' ClearType) for edit box and undocumented syntax. But it does work for some things.

One annoyance is that it's hard to keep track of multiple Writeboards. 37signals once again show strength of their beliefs in "less feautures" mantra. Or it's a gentle way of saying: "if you want to keep track of your writeboards, pay us for our other service, that makes it easy and painless".

I tried to dilligently bookmark all my writeboards but that's very tedious, especially given how broken bookmarking is on every single browser in popular usage.

I found a way to use gmail as a way to automatically keep track of all my writeboards. When you create a new writeboard, you get an e-mail starting with "Your new writeboard". All you need to do is to do a search on "Your new writeboard" in Subject line and there it will be: a list of all your writeboards, automatically updated.

The search query is: "subject:(Your new writeboard)"

I just bookmarked the result. I had to switch to simple html view, because I have no idea how to bookmark a search in the ajaxy interface.

When you delete a page, you can delete corresponding e-mail.
