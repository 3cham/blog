Title: Bloglines vs. Newsgator

Summary: Bloglines is better.

I'm a long time <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> user but I always look for a greener grass so I decided to try <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">Newsgator</a> on-line. I imported my feed list from Bloglines and went on a reading spree.

I'm not switching for two reasons.

Newsgator is way too slow to be usable for reading lots of feeds. Switching to another feed takes few seconds and during that time CPU utilization shoots to 100%, both in IE and in Firefox (I'm guessing some monster JavaScript).

In Bloglines feed list is in a separate frame than the content of the feed. That means that I can scroll the content of the feed but feed list stays at the same position. In Newsgator, after I scroll down the content I have to scroll up to switch to another feed. Not cool.

Bloglines has its problems and Newsgator, overall, looks nice, but the slow speed of switching to another feed is a deal-breaker.
