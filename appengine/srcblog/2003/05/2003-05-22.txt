Title: NY Times on Wiki.

<b>NY Times on Wiki.</b> NY Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/19/technology/19NECO.html?ex=1368763200&en=b816c8c120986d88&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">an 
article about Wikis</a>. Doesn't say anything interesting except that <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">SocialText</a> 
charges $995/year/5 users for their hosted wiki service. An obvious idea (if you 
assume that wikis are any good). 
<p>I just wonder why no-one has written a nice GUI client for wikis. If more firms 
  will offer hosted wikis (and that's very simple) pure wiki will quickly become 
  a commodity and commodity is spelled &quot;thin margins&quot;. GUI client would 
  be one way to stay ahead of a pack. And it isn't that hard to write either. 
  It could either tightly couple with wiki backend or try to establish a de-facto 
  standard of interfacing GUI with server backend so that other wikis could also 
  be modified to work with it. 
<p>I think wikis are great but I'm not going to profess love for it. To me the 
  main (and maybe only) inherent property of wikis is the ease of creation of 
  new pages. Wiki is truly a writeable web. The rest of what we usually associate 
  with wikis (WikiNames, only one namespace for pages, lack of permissions) are 
  accidental features stemming from early implementations. I'm surprised that 
  most implementations (and there are lots of them) perpetuate so many misdesigns 
  of original wiki (my favorite pet-peeves are: WikiNames, no comments, no &quot;Create 
  new page&quot; link (it took me a while to figure out that in order to create 
  a new page in wiki you have to edit some existing page, add a not-yet-existing 
  link to the soon-to-be-created page and then click on this link so that you 
  can finally edit it), lack of hierarchy/namespace for pages). Those are slowly 
  popping up here and there.
