Title: Software idea: CVS viewer (and more).

<b>Software idea: CVS viewer (and more).</b> I have to admit a certain amount 
  of hubris when it comes to designing software: on average I think I could do 
  a better job that the authors of a given software. Take graphical CVS clients, 
  for example. There are many of them out there but none that I tried actually 
  did things I wanted the way I wanted it. Let's sketch the requirements for a 
  good CVS client. I want it to serve two main purposes:
<ul>
  <li>a tool for easily viewing changes to files (i.e. diffs) in CVS repository 
    and handling the obvious stuff that any other CVS gui client handles</li>
  <li>a tool for extracting statistics about the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Those two purposes aren't closely related so it isn't a good idea to have them 
  in the same app, but this is my app and I want to address my needs here.</p>
<p>The tool should work on existing checkouts created with command-line tools 
  (I didn't manage to get WinCVS to do it)</p>
<p>As far as statistics go, I'm mainly interested in quickly deciding about the 
  complexity of the project and whether it's alive or not. Complexity means having 
  statistics about number of lines of code (despite of its crudeness). To decide 
  whether project is alive we just need to look at how much of new code has been 
  checked in. I would like to know daily CVS activity (i.e. number of checkins, 
  number of lines of new code) for the past few days (say 2 weeks) as well as 
  weekly/monthly stats for the whole time of project existence (to see how the 
  project activity evolves in time). Also per-developer stats would be nice (in 
  overview number of contributed lines of code for each person with ability to 
  drill down by person to see list of his checkins over time).
<p>It should be easy to figure out in which checking a given line of code has 
  been modified (e.g. a built-in viewer for the source with ability to point to 
  a line and execute &quot;find checkins that modified this line&quot; command).
<p>It should be possible to filter out files/directories (e.g. Chandler project 
  has a lot of third party code in their repository for ease of development but 
  when I look at their changes I'm not interested in changes to python itself).
<p>It should be easy to see latest changes (as this is what newcomers to a project 
  are most interested in).
<p>And that's it for now - I know it's not very impressing. I get this feeling 
  that writing requirements docs (or any other spec) isn't easy.
