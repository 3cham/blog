Title: Looking for a perfect wiki.

  I've spent the whole weekend looking for a perfect <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiGettingStartedFaq">wiki</a>.
  There was frustration, there were tears. I was looking for something that can
  be used as a private collaboration
tool so an access control was a must. Unfortunately (for me) most wikis, by their
  nature, are very open. I also wanted at least the following features:
<ul>
  <li>pages stored in a database</li>
  <li>users/groups management</li>
  <li>permissions for pages</li>
  <li>ability to add comments to pages</li>
  <li>hierarchical structure</li>
</ul>
  First,
  I gave <a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">Wikipedia
  wiki</a> a shot but it was too much
  tuned for <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> needs. Then I tried
  <a href="http://tikiwiki.sourceforge.net/">TikiWiki</a> - very feature rich
  and looks nice on paper (i.e. on demo site) but after installing it I found
  the default skin to be ugly. <a href="http://www.develnet.org/">coWiki</a> looks
  like the
  closest
  thing
  to
  what I
  want. It looks and has all the features except comments but requires not-yet-released
  PHP5 so I didn't even try to install it. At this point I  gave all hope of
  finding existing implementation that would meet my needs and started fantasizing
  about writing my own. Fortunately  my search led me to <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines">this
  list of existing wikis</a>.
Boy, there are a lot of wiki engines out there and one of them, <a href="http://www.wakkawiki.com/">WakkaWiki</a>,
is almost a perfect fit for me. It's small, written in PHP/MySQL so
there's hope that I can understand the code and modify it to my needs. It has
all the basic features I want except hierarchical structure. I'm a happy man.
During installation I've learned the following:
<ul>
<li>WakkaWiki out-of-the-box doesn't really work without mod_rewrite turned on (it creates bad links for stylesheet files so the page looks terrible; it's easy to fix in the code but even easier by turning mod_rewrite).</li>
<li>to enable mod_rewrite in Apache, I had to do the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>add <tt>LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so</tt> to <tt>httpd.conf</tt></li>
<li>add <tt>AddModule mod_rewrite.c</tt> to <tt>httpd.conf</tt></li>
<li>just to be safe, added <tt>RewriteEngine On</tt> to <tt>httpd.conf</tt></li>
<li>this one was required a bit of detective work: rules for mod_rewrite for the wiki are in the <tt>.htaccess</tt> file in the wiki sub-directory, but the file was ignored until I added <pre>
    &lt;Directory /&gt;
       AllowOverride All
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
	</pre>
	to VirtualHost section in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>. Man, before I figured that out
	I almost learned the way mod_rewrite works (which is a mental-health hazard).
	BTW: if you want to debug what mod_rewrite does, add <tt>RewriteLog logs/rewrite_log.txt</tt> and <tt> RewriteLogLevel 9</tt> to <tt>httpd.conf</tt> (the log is placed relative to <tt>ServerRoot</tt></li>
</ul>
</ul>
Before I go to sleep, here are a few enhancements that I would like to have in WakkaWiki:
<ul>
<li>ability to create hierarchies of pages (as in <a href="http://www.develnet.org/">coWiki</a>)</li>
<li>add group management for permissions</li>
<li>slightly different (less prominent) display of comment. I like the way comments
  were implemented in ACS (you can see an example in <a href="http://www.photo.net/learn/jpeg/">articles
  on photo.net</a>)</li>
<li>user name shouldn't be forced to be a WikiName</li>
<li>don't use pop-up boxes for notifications (e.g. for log out notification)</li>
<li>re-do login screen to be like Amazon.com i.e. only require e-mail/password
  for registration, copy the design and interaction of pages. Add &quot;remember me&quot;
  check-box for increased security (i.e. don't automatically login based on a
  cookie unless this check-box was checked-in)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately the wiki is usable as is and the changes aren't that big so hopefully
  I'll be able to implement them myself.
