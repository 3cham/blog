Title: Carmack on creativity.

<b>Carmack on creativity.</b>
This John Carmack's quote is worth remembering:
<blockquote><i>"Putting creativity on a pedestal can also be an excuse for laziness. 
  There is a lot of cultural belief that creativity comes from inspiration, and 
  can't be rushed. Not true. Inspiration is just your subconscious putting things 
  together, and that can be made into an active process with a little introspection. 
  Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and 
  just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren't sure which 
  way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better." </i>- John Carmack</blockquote>
