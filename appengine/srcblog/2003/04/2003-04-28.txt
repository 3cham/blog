Title: Treo sales numbers.

<b>Treo sales numbers.</b>

According to 
<a href="http://handspring.com/company/pr_q3_comments_041503.jhtml">this article</a> Handspring 
shipped around 180.000 units of Treo in total, 71.000 in last quarter. It's good 
to know because Treo is one of those PDA/Phone combos with GPRS (i.e. you really 
have internet access everywhere) gadgets and there are plenty of interesting 
applications that could be written for a platform like that. But they won't be 
written if the platform is not big enough to sustain commercial software development 
for it. I wonder how does that compare to 
shipments of Sidekick.
