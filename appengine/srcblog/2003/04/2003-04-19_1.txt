Title: Visual diff and merge tool

<b>Visual diff and merge tool.</b>

<a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> is a visual diff and merge tool, currently for Gnome 2 only. 
From the screenshots it looks much like commercial
<a href="http://www.araxis.com/">Araxis Merge</a> (which is a very good and 
polished app). Need to check it out and if it's any good, a port to Windows 
would be in order (which shouldn't be hard given that it's written in Python 
with GUI in GTK+ so porting to wxPython shouldn't be that hard).
