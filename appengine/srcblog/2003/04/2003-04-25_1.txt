Title: Is open-source viable?

<b>Is open-source viable?</b>

He, Cringely <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030424.html">doesn't think so</a> this week. 
He already admitted that next week he'll change his mind, but I'll save you the 
wait and deconstruct Cringely. He says:
<blockquote><i>
Here is the core argument: There are a thousand Open Source projects that get 
started out of need or fun, are maintained for awhile for fame, then get 
abandoned because there is no reason to go on. Eventually, the programmers come 
to understand that "users" are people who yell at you to fix stuff. So Open 
Source is inherently flawed. It only works because otherwise unknown programmers 
can get 15 minutes of fame using the Internet as low-barrier entry into 
introducing their skill to the world. 
</i></blockquote>

There are two problems with this statement. The first part has an exact parallel in non-open-source development: 
there are thousands of non-open-source projects started but, for one reason or 
another, only few become interesting and revenue-generating programs.<p>Second 
problem is a sin of omission: if you accept that need or fun are the only 
reasons for starting open-source projects and those projects are always 
abandoned when &quot;introverted nobodies&quot; realize that it's not fun at all, then it 
open-source could have been &quot;inherently flawed&quot;. When poorly thought out 
hypothetical arguments contradict the facts, I usually stay with the facts. 
Today the fact is: open-source is viable and growing. As long as no-one can 
provide a good argument for why it should stop growing, I'll assume it'll grow 
in the future.</p>
<p>Even Cringely admits that there are successful open-source projects but 
doesn't try to dig into why those projects and not others are successful. Ok, he 
does try by saying that successful open-source projects are those that have 
developers paid by some company but to me it looks like mixing up the cause with 
the effect. Companies pay engineers to work on Linux or Apache or Samba or Gnome 
because it's a successful project, not the other way around (the only landmark 
open-source project that I know of that was sponsored by a company from the 
start is Mozilla).</p>
<p>After that Cringely goes to describe a hijacking attack on open-source. In 
his script, soon to be a major motion picture, an evil entity (which is 
inevitably impersonated by Microsoft) puts their engineers on open-source 
project. They contribute a lot to the project therefore becoming its de-facto 
leaders (this should tip you off that Cringely lives in a dangerously 
imaginative world: as we all know evil entity otherwise known as Microsoft can't 
produce any good software from which we can safely infer that their developers 
would be laughed out of court). Anyway, back to the Cringely plot: after 
becoming de-facto leaders developers steer the development into stray waters and 
make sure that this project will never compete with evil entity's products.</p>
<p>Back in the reality: what prevents such hijacking is a license and the fact 
that those are real humans directing those projects. It's not like you can say: 
hey, let's just something incredibly stupid and they'll say: yeah, great idea. 
And even if you can and they do, someone can always fork from the pre-hijacking 
code.
