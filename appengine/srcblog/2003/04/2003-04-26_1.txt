Title: Bayesian filtering for non-spam detection purposes.

<b>Bayesian filtering for non-spam detection purposes.</b>

I was thinking about using Bayesian filtering for the &quot;news watcher&quot; type of an 
application (i.e. an application that given a keyword(s) would alert you about 
new articles on the web relating to those keywords). One problem is that 
keywords aren't very good for narrowing the search result e.g. if I just gave a 
keyword &quot;Danger&quot; because I wanted to monitor news related to
<a href="http://www.danger.com/">Danger, Inc.</a>, I would probably be flooded 
with lots of irrelevant articles because &quot;danger&quot; is a very common word. From 
what I understand about Bayesian filtering, if I spent some time building a 
database of interesting/un-interesting articles the Bayesian filtering would be 
able to pick up interesting articles based on the content by the way of advanced 
magic. Of course, as is with most of my ideas, I'm not bothering to test the 
hypothesis. Anyway,

this guy</a> did used Bayesian for a text classification not related to spam. 
Interesting and in Python.
