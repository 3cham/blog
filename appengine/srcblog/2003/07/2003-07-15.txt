Title: Memex - "sue me please" device

<b>Memex - "sue me please" device</b>. 
Consider this quote from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm">As we may think</a>:
<blockquote><i>
A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.
</i></blockquote>
Is it just me or does that sound like something RIAA/MPAA/EvilBookPublisher wouldn't like you to do (to the point of suing you if you did)? Does that sound like excessive copyrights stand in the way of progress?
