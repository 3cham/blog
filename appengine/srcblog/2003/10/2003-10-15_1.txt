Title: Positive Treo 600 experience.

<b>Positive Treo 600 experience.</b> <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/">Kevin Werbach</a> has written about his <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2003/10/15.html#a1256">experience using Treo 600</a> (after a few days of usage). He gives it thumbs up. So far most reviews of Treo 600 are very positive. I wonder if it'll translate into sales - when previous version of Treo was launched it was also greeted with enthusiastic reviews but Handspring didn't sell that many of them. I have already ordered upgrade of my Treo 300 to Treo 600 - awaiting shipment.
