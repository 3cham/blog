Title: Treo 600 - more info.
Draft: 1

<b>Treo 600 - more info.</b> CNET has <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1041_3-1018376.html?tag=lh">more information</a> on upcoming Treo 600. On the picture looks very nice. It'll have OS 5.2, (finally) SD slot, (unfortunately only) 160x160 color screen, a keyboard and will be available through Sprint and Orange.
