Title: We don't link, we don't have to. We're Wired.

<b>We don't link, we don't have to. We're Wired.</b> This <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit_pr.html">Wired article about MIT's OpenCourseWare</a> is close to unbelivable: they have a photo of a Vietnamiese guy who happens to use the MIT's web site but there is not a single link to the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">actual site</a> they're writing about.
