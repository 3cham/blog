Title: What would you do if you quit your job?

I've had this conversation several times already: I would share with someone my desire to be wealthy enough to afford not working. Invariably the question that immediately pops up is: but what will you do then? Inability to answer this question in a matter that I felt would be satisfactory was frustrating. I mean, why anyone would even ask this question? 

But now I've found <a href="http://www.gumption.org/1999/ambition.htm">the answer</a>.
