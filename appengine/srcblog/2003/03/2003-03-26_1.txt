Title: Lupy - Python full-text indexer (port of Lucene)

Wait long enough and someone will built it. Some time ago I was looking for a full-text engine that could be used in an application (as there are many applications that would benefit greatly from full-text search). I knew that Lucene had excellent reputation but it was Java and I was looking for something either C or Python. 

Since I didn't find anything I thought that the best way would be to port <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html">Lucene</a> - it's much simpler task that starting something from scratch. Luckily someone had the same need and did just that, producing <a href="http://www.divmod.org/Lupy/index.html">Lupy</a>.
