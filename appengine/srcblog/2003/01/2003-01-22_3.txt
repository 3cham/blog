Title: Online Games Report

<b>Online Games Report.</b>

I found an Online Games Report (direct link: 
<a href="http://www.costik.com/ogrfinal.zip">http://www.costik.com/ogrfinal.zip</a>, it's a zipped 
675k Word document) at
<a href="http://www.costik.com/">Greg's site</a>. It was written in 1999 and  well-worth spending those 4 hours
to read it. An interesting tidbit: the author claimed that either a keyboard or a voice-chat equipment was
essential for online console gaming to take off (reasons included). Looks like 
Microsoft either read this report or developed the same insight (mind you: the 
report was written when X-Box was just rumors and speculation).
