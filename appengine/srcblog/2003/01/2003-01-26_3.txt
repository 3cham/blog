Title: Cheap and good Pocket PC

<b>Cheap and good Pocket PC.</b>
You can buy refurbished Pocket PC Toshiba e740 for $348 at
<a href="http://www.pcnation.com/asp/details.asp?item=81072R">PCNation</a> or 
for $369 at
<a href="http://www.pcrush.com/prodspec.asp?ln=2&itemno=32832&refid=1050">pcRUSH</a>. 
It's a great deal - e740 is the only Pocket PC with integrated wi-fi (otherwise 
expect to spend $100+ for a wi-fi CF card) and the rest of the specs doesn't 
look bad either (64 MB of RAM and 400 MHz).
