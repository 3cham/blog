Title: GForge
Draft: 1

When talking about my &quot;<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/000254.html#000254">p2p, desktop 
Source Forge</a>&quot; idea, I spoke ill about Source Forge (because I think 
their UI is terrible). When VA pretty much stopped working of free code (because 
they now depend on sales of their PRO version) the idea has been picked up by 
one of the original programmers of Source Forge and <a href="http://gforge.org/">
GForge</a> was born. From the looks of it fixes the most annoying UI problems. A 
wonder why it goes the &quot;aggregator&quot; route (i.e. a system for hosting a lot of 
projects). This is a rather limited market (how many Source Forge's can we 
have?). What I would like is something that I can easily deploy on my own 
servers for my own project. In that case some of the functionality doesn't make 
sense. And of course I would prefer it to be a rich, desktop client.
