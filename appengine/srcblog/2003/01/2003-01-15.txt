Title: Somebody's reading

Turns out that somebody's reading this weblog. I got this e-mail from some gentle reader regarding my idea:
<blockquote><i>
There is a commercial app called 
<a href="http://www.relisoft.com/co_op/datasheet.html">Code Coop</a>  that at least talks up many of the same features
that you mention in your posting. It uses email as the transport mechanism instead of the web. 
It comes with its own rich client to manage the files like VSS as well and is supposed to be
able to handle any type of file. 
</i></blockquote>
Here's pretty much my response:<p>
<blockquote><i>
Thanks for the info. Actually I was following Code Co-op quite frequently a few months ago (also
learning from their C++ book and coding tutorials). The only thing that changed since the last time
I visited their web-site is that they've released a new version. But what I had in mind is rather
different. Code Co-op is exactly what they say it is: "Server-Less Version Control System" i.e. CVS via e-mail.
Despite being very sympathetic to Relisoft, there are some problems:
<ul>
<li>in principle I think the idea is interesting but misguided: it solves a problem that no-longer exists
(i.e. not being able to setup a server-based version control system)
<li>it only does the version control system; my "p2p SourceForge" is supposed to do much i.e. bug-tracking,
some sort of content-management system (think p2p wiki adopted for desktop) etc.
</ul>
In my original posting I forgot to mention that what I described is very close to 
<a href="http://www.groove.net">Groove </a>, it's just I was disappointed with how Groove works
(my main complain is that their tools are very primitive; maybe few years from now they'll improve
their existing tools and add a few tools that would cover the needs for managing software projects).
